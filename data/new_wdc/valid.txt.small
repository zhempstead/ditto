With the 50mm f/1.8 you can capture a scene as you perceive it with the naked eye.Silent Wave MotorAF-S NIKKOR lenses feature Nikon’s Silent Wave Motor (SWM). This technology converts “traveling waves” into rotational energy to focus the optics. This enables high-speed autofocusing that's extremely accurate and super quiet.M/ASelect NIKKOR lenses have a focusing mode which allows switching from automatic to manual focusing with virtually no lag time by simply turning the focusing ring on the lens. This makes it possible to seamlessly switch to fine manual focusing while looking through the viewfinder.Aspherical LensA lens with a curved, non-spherical surface. Used to reduce aberrations and enable a more compact lens size. Aspherical lenses minimize coma and other types of lens aberrations, even when used at the widest aperture. They are particularly useful in correcting distortion in wide-angle lenses and help contribute to a lighter, more compact design by reducing the number of standard (spherical) elements necessary. Aspherical lens elements correct these distortions by continuously changing the refractive index from the centre of the lens.Super Integrated CoatingNikon Super Integrated Coating is Nikon's term for its multilayer coating of the optical elements in NIKKOR lenses.

The lens has a maximum aperture of F1.2 making it the world’s brightest autofocus lens for digital cameras with an APS-C sensor. In addition, the new apodising filter makes it the perfect choice for portraiture, with every strand of hair visible and a unique bokeh effect.This lens is highly portable. When attached to an X Series camera body, it weighs about half as much as a single-lens reflex camera with a lens of the same focal length and F value, plus it’s quick to use thanks to the high-speed, quiet autofocus.It produces not only beautiful bokeh part, but also maintain the sharpness with accurate focusing even in a shallow depth-of -field. This is a huge advantage of Mirrorless system over SLR thanks to focusing on image sensor itself rather than on separate PD sensor. The shutter on X Series bodies is equally quiet, so it’s easy to capture more natural shots of subjects.Apodisation filter delivers more creative portraitsThe XF56mm F1.2 R APD offers brilliant levels of sharpness even when shooting with the aperture at F1.2. In addition, the apodisation filter smooths the bokeh’s outlines. This combination of image sharpness and beautiful bokeh delivers portraits with a three-dimensional feel.An optical construction of 11 glass elements in eight groups, including one aspherical glass molded lens element and two extra low dispersion lens elements has been used. Spherical aberrations are corrected by the aspherical glass element to deliver high resolution at the maximum aperture setting. Additionally, thanks to the combination of two extra-low dispersion lens elements and three cemented lens elements, chromatic aberrations are greatly reduced.By applying Fujifilm’s unique HT-EBC (High Transmittance Electron Beam Coating) to all lens surfaces, ghosting and flare are controlled for sharp, clear results.The lens also makes the most of Fujifilm’s unique X-TransTM CMOS low pass filter-less sensor for extremely high image quality. Ghosting and flare are controlled even under harsh conditions such as backlighting.By combining this lens with an X Series camera body with Lens Modulation Optimiser (LMO) technology, the performance from the lens is improved even further. LMO corrects for diffraction to produce images with edge-to-edge sharpness and create a realistic three-dimensional effect, even at small apertures.Autofocusing for a lens with an apodisation filterIn the past, an apodisation filter has only been used on a manual focus lens, this is the first to use high-precision contrast AF.Combined with an X Series camera body, more natural shots of subjects are possible thanks to the near-silent shutter sound.Film-like effects with the Film Simulation functionX Series interchangeable lens cameras are equipped with Film Simulation modes, which have been developed using Fujifilm’s knowledge from 80 years of manufacturing to deliver film-like colours and tones. Combining this lens with the Pro Neg. Film Simulation mode, which is specifically designed for portrait photography, reproduces beautiful skin tones.High build quality and comfortable operationThe apodisation filter delivers its best results at wider apertures. To enable wide apertures to be used even in bright environments, an ND filter is included that adjusts brightness in three levels. To indicate the apodising effect, the lens features an aperture ring showing the effective FNo. in red. The difference between the FNo. and the effective FNo. indicates the effectiveness of the apodisation filter.Both the focus and aperture rings are metal, plus metal is also used on the exterior of the lens body for a high-quality finish. The texture and torque on the rings makes for comfortable shooting even for delicate manual focusing. COL price VAL 899.5 COL priceCurrency VAL GBP	0

The 50mm focal length (75mm equivalent on DX format cameras) with a fast f/1.8 aperture allows you to capture stunning images with a shallow depth-of-field, letting your subjects stand out from their backgrounds. The AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G may soon become your new favourite lens.Get astonishing low light resultsThis lightweight standard lens is a great travel companion because you never know when a beautiful, sunny day will turn cloudy and rainy. With its fast f/1.8 aperture, the AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G will capture even low-light situations with stunning brilliance.Achieve more natural depth of fieldWhether you're shooting portraits, food or nature—indoors or outdoors—the AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G renders a beautiful, natural background blur (Bokeh) at its wider aperture settings. And its 50mm focal length is perfect for creating natural perspective in your photographs.Shoot pin-sharp portraits every timeNikon's Super Integrated Coating (SIC) enhances light transmission efficiency and offers superior colour consistency and reduced flare, while the AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G's Aspherical Lens Element (AS) virtually eliminates coma and other types of aberrations, even when shooting at the widest available aperture.

With the 50mm f/1.8 you can capture a scene as you perceive it with the naked eye.Silent Wave MotorAF-S NIKKOR lenses feature Nikon’s Silent Wave Motor (SWM). This technology converts “traveling waves” into rotational energy to focus the optics. This enables high-speed autofocusing that's extremely accurate and super quiet.M/ASelect NIKKOR lenses have a focusing mode which allows switching from automatic to manual focusing with virtually no lag time by simply turning the focusing ring on the lens. This makes it possible to seamlessly switch to fine manual focusing while looking through the viewfinder.Aspherical LensA lens with a curved, non-spherical surface. Used to reduce aberrations and enable a more compact lens size. Aspherical lenses minimize coma and other types of lens aberrations, even when used at the widest aperture. They are particularly useful in correcting distortion in wide-angle lenses and help contribute to a lighter, more compact design by reducing the number of standard (spherical) elements necessary. Aspherical lens elements correct these distortions by continuously changing the refractive index from the centre of the lens.Super Integrated CoatingNikon Super Integrated Coating is Nikon's term for its multilayer coating of the optical elements in NIKKOR lenses.

The lens has a maximum aperture of F1.2 making it the world’s brightest autofocus lens for digital cameras with an APS-C sensor. In addition, the new apodising filter makes it the perfect choice for portraiture, with every strand of hair visible and a unique bokeh effect.This lens is highly portable. When attached to an X Series camera body, it weighs about half as much as a single-lens reflex camera with a lens of the same focal length and F value, plus it’s quick to use thanks to the high-speed, quiet autofocus.It produces not only beautiful bokeh part, but also maintain the sharpness with accurate focusing even in a shallow depth-of -field. This is a huge advantage of Mirrorless system over SLR thanks to focusing on image sensor itself rather than on separate PD sensor. The shutter on X Series bodies is equally quiet, so it’s easy to capture more natural shots of subjects.Apodisation filter delivers more creative portraitsThe XF56mm F1.2 R APD offers brilliant levels of sharpness even when shooting with the aperture at F1.2. In addition, the apodisation filter smooths the bokeh’s outlines. This combination of image sharpness and beautiful bokeh delivers portraits with a three-dimensional feel.An optical construction of 11 glass elements in eight groups, including one aspherical glass molded lens element and two extra low dispersion lens elements has been used. Spherical aberrations are corrected by the aspherical glass element to deliver high resolution at the maximum aperture setting. Additionally, thanks to the combination of two extra-low dispersion lens elements and three cemented lens elements, chromatic aberrations are greatly reduced.By applying Fujifilm’s unique HT-EBC (High Transmittance Electron Beam Coating) to all lens surfaces, ghosting and flare are controlled for sharp, clear results.The lens also makes the most of Fujifilm’s unique X-TransTM CMOS low pass filter-less sensor for extremely high image quality. Ghosting and flare are controlled even under harsh conditions such as backlighting.By combining this lens with an X Series camera body with Lens Modulation Optimiser (LMO) technology, the performance from the lens is improved even further. LMO corrects for diffraction to produce images with edge-to-edge sharpness and create a realistic three-dimensional effect, even at small apertures.Autofocusing for a lens with an apodisation filterIn the past, an apodisation filter has only been used on a manual focus lens, this is the first to use high-precision contrast AF.Combined with an X Series camera body, more natural shots of subjects are possible thanks to the near-silent shutter sound.Film-like effects with the Film Simulation functionX Series interchangeable lens cameras are equipped with Film Simulation modes, which have been developed using Fujifilm’s knowledge from 80 years of manufacturing to deliver film-like colours and tones. Combining this lens with the Pro Neg. Film Simulation mode, which is specifically designed for portrait photography, reproduces beautiful skin tones.High build quality and comfortable operationThe apodisation filter delivers its best results at wider apertures. To enable wide apertures to be used even in bright environments, an ND filter is included that adjusts brightness in three levels. To indicate the apodising effect, the lens features an aperture ring showing the effective FNo. in red. The difference between the FNo. and the effective FNo. indicates the effectiveness of the apodisation filter.Both the focus and aperture rings are metal, plus metal is also used on the exterior of the lens body for a high-quality finish. The texture and torque on the rings makes for comfortable shooting even for delicate manual focusing. COL price VAL 899.5 COL priceCurrency VAL GBP	0

The ProLite XU2390HS will provide excellent performance for photographic design, web design, standard office use and in multi-monitor environment. Very suitable for multi-monitor Digtal Signage and office applications.IPSThe IPS panel technology guarantees consistent colour reproduction with wide viewing angles and high contrast and therefore it is especially recommended for graphics design and other applications which require colours to be displayed accurately.

Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in your body deplete over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinol and shilajitThe traditional form of CoQ10, ubiquinone, is difficult for the body to absorb. But another form, ubiquinol, has been shown to absorb up to 8 times greater than ubiquinone. That's why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system with superior absorption levels.Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie shilajit is an adaptogen shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP — the main source of cellular energy.12-17 When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, it has been clinically shown to double levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.18 Shilajit prolongs CoQ10's efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form19,20 and facilitates greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.In middle-aged mice, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared to ubiquinone. In another preliminary study in mice, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain — 40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.Breakthrough longevity and cellular energy formulaResearch supports the value of this unique combination of ubiquinol CoQ10 and shilajit. That's why we've created Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support, to create a powerful synergy that supports heart health and youthful cellular energy production better than CoQ10 alone.For younger consumers or people with no known heart health issues, we recommend a daily CoQ10 supplement with at least 100 mg of ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10. For older customers or those with heart health concerns, we recommend 200 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per day. We also offer 50 mg CoQ10 supplements for those who wish to take a lower dose or who wish to spread their CoQ10 intake throughout the day. This supplement contains 50 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per softgel. COL price VAL 20.15 COL priceCurrency VAL EUR	0

COL title VAL Life Extension - Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support 50mg - 30 softgels COL description VAL DescriptionSuper Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support is formulated with ubiquinol, a highly bioavailable form of coenzyme Q10 nutrient, and augmented with the adaptogen PrimaVie shilajit, clinically shown to further increase CoQ10 absorption, promote cardiovascular health, and help restore youthful cellular energy.Benefits at a Glance:Ubiquinol CoQ10 absorbs up to 8 times better than ubiquinone CoQ10Promotes cellular energy production in heart, brain and muscle tissueProvides superior cardiovascular and antioxidant supportPrimaVie shilajit enhances mitochondrial CoQ10 absorptionCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level.1 Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain, liver, kidneys, and (most importantly) your heart.CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins5 and mitochondrial DNA6 from oxidative damage. Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in your body deplete over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinol and shilajitThe traditional form of CoQ10, ubiquinone, is difficult for the body to absorb. But another form, ubiquinol, has been shown to absorb up to 8 times greater than ubiquinone. That's why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system with superior absorption levels.Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie shilajit is an adaptogen shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP — the main source of cellular energy.12-17 When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, it has been clinically shown to double levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.18 Shilajit prolongs CoQ10's efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form19,20 and facilitates greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.In middle-aged mice, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared to ubiquinone. In another preliminary study in mice, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain — 40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.Breakthrough longevity and cellular energy formulaResearch supports the value of this unique combination of ubiquinol CoQ10 and shilajit. That's why we've created Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support, to create a powerful synergy that supports heart health and youthful cellular energy production better than CoQ10 alone.For younger consumers or people with no known heart health issues, we recommend a daily CoQ10 supplement with at least 100 mg of ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10. For older customers or those with heart health concerns, we recommend 200 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per day. We also offer 50 mg CoQ10 supplements for those who wish to take a lower dose or who wish to spread their CoQ10 intake throughout the day. This supplement contains 50 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per softgel.

The ProLite XU2390HS will provide excellent performance for photographic design, web design, standard office use and in multi-monitor environment. Very suitable for multi-monitor Digtal Signage and office applications.IPSThe IPS panel technology guarantees consistent colour reproduction with wide viewing angles and high contrast and therefore it is especially recommended for graphics design and other applications which require colours to be displayed accurately. The response time of the panel allows for smooth playback while watching films and playing games, making the IPS the best all-round technology suitable for both business and home use.FULL HDWith true 1920 x 1080p resolution your monitor is ready to display high definition images.

Advanced Contrast Ratio is a feature that automatically adjusts contrast and brightness of the screen to assure perfect picture quality while watching films and playing games.HDMIHDMI stands for High-Definition Multimedia Interface.

The lens has a maximum aperture of F1.2 making it the world’s brightest autofocus lens for digital cameras with an APS-C sensor. In addition, the new apodising filter makes it the perfect choice for portraiture, with every strand of hair visible and a unique bokeh effect.This lens is highly portable. When attached to an X Series camera body, it weighs about half as much as a single-lens reflex camera with a lens of the same focal length and F value, plus it’s quick to use thanks to the high-speed, quiet autofocus.It produces not only beautiful bokeh part, but also maintain the sharpness with accurate focusing even in a shallow depth-of -field. This is a huge advantage of Mirrorless system over SLR thanks to focusing on image sensor itself rather than on separate PD sensor. The shutter on X Series bodies is equally quiet, so it’s easy to capture more natural shots of subjects.Apodisation filter delivers more creative portraitsThe XF56mm F1.2 R APD offers brilliant levels of sharpness even when shooting with the aperture at F1.2. In addition, the apodisation filter smooths the bokeh’s outlines. This combination of image sharpness and beautiful bokeh delivers portraits with a three-dimensional feel.An optical construction of 11 glass elements in eight groups, including one aspherical glass molded lens element and two extra low dispersion lens elements has been used. Spherical aberrations are corrected by the aspherical glass element to deliver high resolution at the maximum aperture setting. Additionally, thanks to the combination of two extra-low dispersion lens elements and three cemented lens elements, chromatic aberrations are greatly reduced.By applying Fujifilm’s unique HT-EBC (High Transmittance Electron Beam Coating) to all lens surfaces, ghosting and flare are controlled for sharp, clear results.The lens also makes the most of Fujifilm’s unique X-TransTM CMOS low pass filter-less sensor for extremely high image quality. Ghosting and flare are controlled even under harsh conditions such as backlighting.By combining this lens with an X Series camera body with Lens Modulation Optimiser (LMO) technology, the performance from the lens is improved even further. LMO corrects for diffraction to produce images with edge-to-edge sharpness and create a realistic three-dimensional effect, even at small apertures.Autofocusing for a lens with an apodisation filterIn the past, an apodisation filter has only been used on a manual focus lens, this is the first to use high-precision contrast AF.Combined with an X Series camera body, more natural shots of subjects are possible thanks to the near-silent shutter sound.Film-like effects with the Film Simulation functionX Series interchangeable lens cameras are equipped with Film Simulation modes, which have been developed using Fujifilm’s knowledge from 80 years of manufacturing to deliver film-like colours and tones. Combining this lens with the Pro Neg. Film Simulation mode, which is specifically designed for portrait photography, reproduces beautiful skin tones.High build quality and comfortable operationThe apodisation filter delivers its best results at wider apertures. To enable wide apertures to be used even in bright environments, an ND filter is included that adjusts brightness in three levels. To indicate the apodising effect, the lens features an aperture ring showing the effective FNo. in red. The difference between the FNo. and the effective FNo. indicates the effectiveness of the apodisation filter.Both the focus and aperture rings are metal, plus metal is also used on the exterior of the lens body for a high-quality finish. The texture and torque on the rings makes for comfortable shooting even for delicate manual focusing. COL price VAL 899.5 COL priceCurrency VAL GBP	0

COL title VAL Fujifilm XF-56mm f1.2 APD COL price VAL 999.00	COL title VAL Fujifilm 56mm f1.2 R XF APD Lens COL description VAL X-Mount Lens/APS-C Format85mm (35mm Equivalent)Aperture Range: f/1.2 to f/16Apodization Filter for Smooth BokehOne Double-Sided Aspherical ElementTwo Extra-Low Dispersion ElementsSuper EBC CoatingInternal Focusing MechanismRounded 7-Blade DiaphragmThe FUJINON 56mm F1.2 XF R APD is an autofocus lens for digital cameras with APS-C size sensor and provides a focal length equivalent to 85mm. The lens has a maximum aperture of F1.2 making it the world’s brightest autofocus lens for digital cameras with an APS-C sensor. In addition, the new apodising filter makes it the perfect choice for portraiture, with every strand of hair visible and a unique bokeh effect.This lens is highly portable. When attached to an X Series camera body, it weighs about half as much as a single-lens reflex camera with a lens of the same focal length and F value, plus it’s quick to use thanks to the high-speed, quiet autofocus.It produces not only beautiful bokeh part, but also maintain the sharpness with accurate focusing even in a shallow depth-of -field. This is a huge advantage of Mirrorless system over SLR thanks to focusing on image sensor itself rather than on separate PD sensor. The shutter on X Series bodies is equally quiet, so it’s easy to capture more natural shots of subjects.Apodisation filter delivers more creative portraitsThe XF56mm F1.2 R APD offers brilliant levels of sharpness even when shooting with the aperture at F1.2. In addition, the apodisation filter smooths the bokeh’s outlines. This combination of image sharpness and beautiful bokeh delivers portraits with a three-dimensional feel.An optical construction of 11 glass elements in eight groups, including one aspherical glass molded lens element and two extra low dispersion lens elements has been used. Spherical aberrations are corrected by the aspherical glass element to deliver high resolution at the maximum aperture setting. Additionally, thanks to the combination of two extra-low dispersion lens elements and three cemented lens elements, chromatic aberrations are greatly reduced.By applying Fujifilm’s unique HT-EBC (High Transmittance Electron Beam Coating) to all lens surfaces, ghosting and flare are controlled for sharp, clear results.The lens also makes the most of Fujifilm’s unique X-TransTM CMOS low pass filter-less sensor for extremely high image quality. Ghosting and flare are controlled even under harsh conditions such as backlighting.By combining this lens with an X Series camera body with Lens Modulation Optimiser (LMO) technology, the performance from the lens is improved even further. LMO corrects for diffraction to produce images with edge-to-edge sharpness and create a realistic three-dimensional effect, even at small apertures.Autofocusing for a lens with an apodisation filterIn the past, an apodisation filter has only been used on a manual focus lens, this is the first to use high-precision contrast AF.Combined with an X Series camera body, more natural shots of subjects are possible thanks to the near-silent shutter sound.Film-like effects with the Film Simulation functionX Series interchangeable lens cameras are equipped with Film Simulation modes, which have been developed using Fujifilm’s knowledge from 80 years of manufacturing to deliver film-like colours and tones. Combining this lens with the Pro Neg. Film Simulation mode, which is specifically designed for portrait photography, reproduces beautiful skin tones.High build quality and comfortable operationThe apodisation filter delivers its best results at wider apertures. To enable wide apertures to be used even in bright environments, an ND filter is included that adjusts brightness in three levels. To indicate the apodising effect, the lens features an aperture ring showing the effective FNo. in red. The difference between the FNo. and the effective FNo. indicates the effectiveness of the apodisation filter.Both the focus and aperture rings are metal, plus metal is also used on the exterior of the lens body for a high-quality finish. The texture and torque on the rings makes for comfortable shooting even for delicate manual focusing. COL price VAL 899.5 COL priceCurrency VAL GBP	1

This processor features a boost speed of up to 4.4 GHz, or up to 4.5 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 technology. Additionally, this processor features 10 cores with 20 threads in an LGA 2066 socket, has 19.25MB of cache memory, and supports up to 44 PCIe lanes. Having 10 cores allows the processor to run multiple programs simultaneously without slowing down the system, while the 20 threads allow a basic ordered sequence of instructions to be passed through or processed by a single CPU core. This processor also supports DDR4 RAM and utilizes 9th-generation technology.Graphically, the Core i9-9900X does not contain any integrated graphics, which means that users will need to purchase a compatible dedicated GPU of their choice.

However, this is not recommended, as it will void the limited 3-year warranty.Please note that this processor does not include a heatsink or fan and requires a separately-sold CPU cooling solution.

The AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G may soon become your new favourite lens.Get astonishing low light resultsThis lightweight standard lens is a great travel companion because you never know when a beautiful, sunny day will turn cloudy and rainy. With its fast f/1.8 aperture, the AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G will capture even low-light situations with stunning brilliance.Achieve more natural depth of fieldWhether you're shooting portraits, food or nature—indoors or outdoors—the AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G renders a beautiful, natural background blur (Bokeh) at its wider aperture settings. And its 50mm focal length is perfect for creating natural perspective in your photographs.Shoot pin-sharp portraits every timeNikon's Super Integrated Coating (SIC) enhances light transmission efficiency and offers superior colour consistency and reduced flare, while the AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G's Aspherical Lens Element (AS) virtually eliminates coma and other types of aberrations, even when shooting at the widest available aperture.

With the 50mm f/1.8 you can capture a scene as you perceive it with the naked eye.Silent Wave MotorAF-S NIKKOR lenses feature Nikon’s Silent Wave Motor (SWM). This technology converts “traveling waves” into rotational energy to focus the optics. This enables high-speed autofocusing that's extremely accurate and super quiet.M/ASelect NIKKOR lenses have a focusing mode which allows switching from automatic to manual focusing with virtually no lag time by simply turning the focusing ring on the lens. This makes it possible to seamlessly switch to fine manual focusing while looking through the viewfinder.Aspherical LensA lens with a curved, non-spherical surface. Used to reduce aberrations and enable a more compact lens size. Aspherical lenses minimize coma and other types of lens aberrations, even when used at the widest aperture. They are particularly useful in correcting distortion in wide-angle lenses and help contribute to a lighter, more compact design by reducing the number of standard (spherical) elements necessary. Aspherical lens elements correct these distortions by continuously changing the refractive index from the centre of the lens.Super Integrated CoatingNikon Super Integrated Coating is Nikon's term for its multilayer coating of the optical elements in NIKKOR lenses.

COL title VAL Life Extension - Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support 50mg - 30 softgels COL description VAL DescriptionSuper Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support is formulated with ubiquinol, a highly bioavailable form of coenzyme Q10 nutrient, and augmented with the adaptogen PrimaVie shilajit, clinically shown to further increase CoQ10 absorption, promote cardiovascular health, and help restore youthful cellular energy.Benefits at a Glance:Ubiquinol CoQ10 absorbs up to 8 times better than ubiquinone CoQ10Promotes cellular energy production in heart, brain and muscle tissueProvides superior cardiovascular and antioxidant supportPrimaVie shilajit enhances mitochondrial CoQ10 absorptionCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level.1 Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain, liver, kidneys, and (most importantly) your heart.CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins5 and mitochondrial DNA6 from oxidative damage. Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in your body deplete over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinol and shilajitThe traditional form of CoQ10, ubiquinone, is difficult for the body to absorb. But another form, ubiquinol, has been shown to absorb up to 8 times greater than ubiquinone. That's why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system with superior absorption levels.Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie shilajit is an adaptogen shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP — the main source of cellular energy.12-17 When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, it has been clinically shown to double levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.18 Shilajit prolongs CoQ10's efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form19,20 and facilitates greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.In middle-aged mice, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared to ubiquinone. In another preliminary study in mice, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain — 40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.Breakthrough longevity and cellular energy formulaResearch supports the value of this unique combination of ubiquinol CoQ10 and shilajit. That's why we've created Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support, to create a powerful synergy that supports heart health and youthful cellular energy production better than CoQ10 alone.For younger consumers or people with no known heart health issues, we recommend a daily CoQ10 supplement with at least 100 mg of ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10. For older customers or those with heart health concerns, we recommend 200 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per day. We also offer 50 mg CoQ10 supplements for those who wish to take a lower dose or who wish to spread their CoQ10 intake throughout the day. This supplement contains 50 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per softgel.

This is natural fat from the unprocessed leather and is evidence of the TN's raw natural state; it is easily removed with a quick wipe using a soft cloth.As you use your Traveler's Notebook, it takes on character; a map of your travels and a mark of its use. Over the years, Traveler's Notebook will become your lifetime companion. Care for your Traveler's Notebook by buffing and nurturing the leather and it will stay in optimum condition for many years to come.The really special thing about the Traveler's Notebook is the range of accessories and refills available.

COL brand VAL iiyama COL title VAL iiyama ProLite XU2390HS 23 Inch Full HD LED Flat Black computer monitor COL description VAL 23â€ monitor with IPS panel and ultra flat frontProLite XU2390HS is a 23â€ LED backlit LCD Screen featuring IPS Panel technology which is considered to be the best all round panel type. It offers accurate and consistent colour reproduction with wide viewing angles (178Â°/178Â°) and fast response time (5 ms black-to-black). XU2380HS is full HD, has a >5mln:1 Advanced Contrast Ratio and 250 cd/mÂ² brightness offering the user a clear and vivid image. The ProLite XU2390HS will provide excellent performance for photographic design, web design, standard office use and in multi-monitor environment. Very suitable for multi-monitor Digtal Signage and office applications.IPSThe IPS panel technology guarantees consistent colour reproduction with wide viewing angles and high contrast and therefore it is especially recommended for graphics design and other applications which require colours to be displayed accurately. The response time of the panel allows for smooth playback while watching films and playing games, making the IPS the best all-round technology suitable for both business and home use.FULL HDWith true 1920 x 1080p resolution your monitor is ready to display high definition images. This means you can accommodate more information on your screen; e.g. 60% more in comparison to a 1280 x 1024 monitor.LED-BACKLITA typical CCFL LCD uses four backlight lamps. Using LED diodes considerably lowers the power consumption and reduces the CO2 emission into the environment making this LCD a true ECO-Friendly product.ACRContrast Ratio is a measurement of the difference between the darkest black and the brightest white your monitor can display. Advanced Contrast Ratio is a feature that automatically adjusts contrast and brightness of the screen to assure perfect picture quality while watching films and playing games.HDMIHDMI stands for High-Definition Multimedia Interface. Much smaller and more convenient than DVI, HDMI also has the significant advantage over DVI that it supports audio as well as video signals.OverDrive ON / OFFWhen very fast graphics are displayed your monitor can sometimes get blurry. Turning on the OverDrive feature will eliminate that.

Additionally, this processor features 10 cores with 20 threads in an LGA 2066 socket, has 19.25MB of cache memory, and supports up to 44 PCIe lanes.

COL title VAL Life Extension - Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support 50mg - 30 softgels COL description VAL DescriptionSuper Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support is formulated with ubiquinol, a highly bioavailable form of coenzyme Q10 nutrient, and augmented with the adaptogen PrimaVie shilajit, clinically shown to further increase CoQ10 absorption, promote cardiovascular health, and help restore youthful cellular energy.Benefits at a Glance:Ubiquinol CoQ10 absorbs up to 8 times better than ubiquinone CoQ10Promotes cellular energy production in heart, brain and muscle tissueProvides superior cardiovascular and antioxidant supportPrimaVie shilajit enhances mitochondrial CoQ10 absorptionCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level.1 Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain, liver, kidneys, and (most importantly) your heart.CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins5 and mitochondrial DNA6 from oxidative damage. Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in your body deplete over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinol and shilajitThe traditional form of CoQ10, ubiquinone, is difficult for the body to absorb. But another form, ubiquinol, has been shown to absorb up to 8 times greater than ubiquinone. That's why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system with superior absorption levels.Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie shilajit is an adaptogen shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP — the main source of cellular energy.12-17 When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, it has been clinically shown to double levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.18 Shilajit prolongs CoQ10's efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form19,20 and facilitates greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.In middle-aged mice, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared to ubiquinone. In another preliminary study in mice, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain — 40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.Breakthrough longevity and cellular energy formulaResearch supports the value of this unique combination of ubiquinol CoQ10 and shilajit. That's why we've created Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support, to create a powerful synergy that supports heart health and youthful cellular energy production better than CoQ10 alone.For younger consumers or people with no known heart health issues, we recommend a daily CoQ10 supplement with at least 100 mg of ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10. For older customers or those with heart health concerns, we recommend 200 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per day. We also offer 50 mg CoQ10 supplements for those who wish to take a lower dose or who wish to spread their CoQ10 intake throughout the day. This supplement contains 50 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per softgel.

COL title VAL Fujifilm 56mm f1.2 R XF APD Lens COL description VAL X-Mount Lens/APS-C Format85mm (35mm Equivalent)Aperture Range: f/1.2 to f/16Apodization Filter for Smooth BokehOne Double-Sided Aspherical ElementTwo Extra-Low Dispersion ElementsSuper EBC CoatingInternal Focusing MechanismRounded 7-Blade DiaphragmThe FUJINON 56mm F1.2 XF R APD is an autofocus lens for digital cameras with APS-C size sensor and provides a focal length equivalent to 85mm. The lens has a maximum aperture of F1.2 making it the world’s brightest autofocus lens for digital cameras with an APS-C sensor. In addition, the new apodising filter makes it the perfect choice for portraiture, with every strand of hair visible and a unique bokeh effect.This lens is highly portable. When attached to an X Series camera body, it weighs about half as much as a single-lens reflex camera with a lens of the same focal length and F value, plus it’s quick to use thanks to the high-speed, quiet autofocus.It produces not only beautiful bokeh part, but also maintain the sharpness with accurate focusing even in a shallow depth-of -field. This is a huge advantage of Mirrorless system over SLR thanks to focusing on image sensor itself rather than on separate PD sensor. The shutter on X Series bodies is equally quiet, so it’s easy to capture more natural shots of subjects.Apodisation filter delivers more creative portraitsThe XF56mm F1.2 R APD offers brilliant levels of sharpness even when shooting with the aperture at F1.2. In addition, the apodisation filter smooths the bokeh’s outlines. This combination of image sharpness and beautiful bokeh delivers portraits with a three-dimensional feel.An optical construction of 11 glass elements in eight groups, including one aspherical glass molded lens element and two extra low dispersion lens elements has been used. Spherical aberrations are corrected by the aspherical glass element to deliver high resolution at the maximum aperture setting. Additionally, thanks to the combination of two extra-low dispersion lens elements and three cemented lens elements, chromatic aberrations are greatly reduced.By applying Fujifilm’s unique HT-EBC (High Transmittance Electron Beam Coating) to all lens surfaces, ghosting and flare are controlled for sharp, clear results.The lens also makes the most of Fujifilm’s unique X-TransTM CMOS low pass filter-less sensor for extremely high image quality. Ghosting and flare are controlled even under harsh conditions such as backlighting.By combining this lens with an X Series camera body with Lens Modulation Optimiser (LMO) technology, the performance from the lens is improved even further. LMO corrects for diffraction to produce images with edge-to-edge sharpness and create a realistic three-dimensional effect, even at small apertures.Autofocusing for a lens with an apodisation filterIn the past, an apodisation filter has only been used on a manual focus lens, this is the first to use high-precision contrast AF.Combined with an X Series camera body, more natural shots of subjects are possible thanks to the near-silent shutter sound.Film-like effects with the Film Simulation functionX Series interchangeable lens cameras are equipped with Film Simulation modes, which have been developed using Fujifilm’s knowledge from 80 years of manufacturing to deliver film-like colours and tones. Combining this lens with the Pro Neg. Film Simulation mode, which is specifically designed for portrait photography, reproduces beautiful skin tones.High build quality and comfortable operationThe apodisation filter delivers its best results at wider apertures. To enable wide apertures to be used even in bright environments, an ND filter is included that adjusts brightness in three levels. To indicate the apodising effect, the lens features an aperture ring showing the effective FNo. in red. The difference between the FNo. and the effective FNo. indicates the effectiveness of the apodisation filter.Both the focus and aperture rings are metal, plus metal is also used on the exterior of the lens body for a high-quality finish. The texture and torque on the rings makes for comfortable shooting even for delicate manual focusing.

The ProLite XU2390HS will provide excellent performance for photographic design, web design, standard office use and in multi-monitor environment. Very suitable for multi-monitor Digtal Signage and office applications.IPSThe IPS panel technology guarantees consistent colour reproduction with wide viewing angles and high contrast and therefore it is especially recommended for graphics design and other applications which require colours to be displayed accurately. The response time of the panel allows for smooth playback while watching films and playing games, making the IPS the best all-round technology suitable for both business and home use.FULL HDWith true 1920 x 1080p resolution your monitor is ready to display high definition images.

COL title VAL Nikon 50mm f1.8G AF-S NIKKOR Lens COL description VAL F-Mount Lens/FX FormatAperture Range: f/1.8 to f/16One Aspherical ElementSuper Integrated CoatingSilent Wave Motor AF SystemRounded 7-Blade DiaphragmA must-have for standard portraits and everyday use, the AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G is a lens that will absolutely surprise you. The 50mm focal length (75mm equivalent on DX format cameras) with a fast f/1.8 aperture allows you to capture stunning images with a shallow depth-of-field, letting your subjects stand out from their backgrounds. The AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G may soon become your new favourite lens.Get astonishing low light resultsThis lightweight standard lens is a great travel companion because you never know when a beautiful, sunny day will turn cloudy and rainy. With its fast f/1.8 aperture, the AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G will capture even low-light situations with stunning brilliance.Achieve more natural depth of fieldWhether you're shooting portraits, food or nature—indoors or outdoors—the AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G renders a beautiful, natural background blur (Bokeh) at its wider aperture settings. And its 50mm focal length is perfect for creating natural perspective in your photographs.Shoot pin-sharp portraits every timeNikon's Super Integrated Coating (SIC) enhances light transmission efficiency and offers superior colour consistency and reduced flare, while the AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G's Aspherical Lens Element (AS) virtually eliminates coma and other types of aberrations, even when shooting at the widest available aperture. Pair that with Nikon's Silent Wave Motor (SWM) for fast, accurate and quiet autofocus, and you can be sure all of your portraits will be pin sharp.Push your creativity to the limitThe AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G is invaluable for shooting a wide variety of outdoor scenes. With the 50mm f/1.8 you can capture a scene as you perceive it with the naked eye.Silent Wave MotorAF-S NIKKOR lenses feature Nikon’s Silent Wave Motor (SWM). This technology converts “traveling waves” into rotational energy to focus the optics. This enables high-speed autofocusing that's extremely accurate and super quiet.M/ASelect NIKKOR lenses have a focusing mode which allows switching from automatic to manual focusing with virtually no lag time by simply turning the focusing ring on the lens. This makes it possible to seamlessly switch to fine manual focusing while looking through the viewfinder.Aspherical LensA lens with a curved, non-spherical surface. Used to reduce aberrations and enable a more compact lens size. Aspherical lenses minimize coma and other types of lens aberrations, even when used at the widest aperture. They are particularly useful in correcting distortion in wide-angle lenses and help contribute to a lighter, more compact design by reducing the number of standard (spherical) elements necessary. Aspherical lens elements correct these distortions by continuously changing the refractive index from the centre of the lens.Super Integrated CoatingNikon Super Integrated Coating is Nikon's term for its multilayer coating of the optical elements in NIKKOR lenses.
