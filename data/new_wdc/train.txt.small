The camera features Smart Autotracking that is designed to automatically control the direction and zoom-level of the PTZ configurations of the camera for optimised camera view. This function may be used to provide automatic, visual confirmation of detected objects reducing the rate of false alarms and can also ensure that any potential intruder remains within the camera’s line of sight.The intuitive interface of the camera allows for quick and easy remote calibration to ensure that the camera’s settings are appropriately configured in view of its operation conditions and environment.The camera is ideally suited to deployment in demanding outdoor environments where pan/tilt/zoom functionality would be an advantage, such as perimeter surveillance and airports, roads, railways, squares, parks, scenic spots, and other open venues. Advanced gatekeeper technology can be configured to move the camera to a pre-set position upon triggering of an alarm event before returning the camera to a default position after a pre-configured interval, a useful feature for applications such as facial identification. As well as this, the camera has day/night functionality, providing a round-the-clock monitoring solution. During daylight hours, the camera provides a HD colour image, switching at night-time or during periods of very poor lighting conditions to an infrared-sensitive black and white image.

From the Dissector Troy Brosnan wanted to create a “unicorn” tire – a center tread design that carried speed easily but with edge blocks worthy of world-class cornering speed. The Dissector center knobs are all heavily ramped to minimize drag but retain sharp flat edges along their backs to provide strong braking traction. Small sipes give the knobs additional flexion increasing their surface area during braking and aiding the transition to the edge blocks when cornering. A distinct channel along either side of the center knobs – along with ample spacing between all lugs – helps to clear debris.Recommended as a rear tire TECH SPECSISO Diameter 622 / road / 29"Tire Diameter 29"Weight 861Color BlackTire Intended Use MountainISO Width (mm) 61TPI 60Tire Bead FoldingPSI 50Tire Type Tubeless Ready ClincherDefined Color BlackLabeled Size 29 x 2.4 COL price VAL 68.00 COL priceCurrency VAL USD	0

COL title VAL FUJIFILM Aspherical Super EBC XF 80mm f/2.8 R LM OIS WR Macro Lens COL description VAL The FUJIFILM Aspherical Super EBC XF 80mm f/2.8 R LM OIS WR Macro Lens s a 122mm equivalent telephoto prime for X-mount mirrorless cameras. The long focal length coupled with the f/2.8 maximum aperture is well-suited to isolating subject matter, especially when paired with the short 9.8\" minimum focusing distance, and a 1:1 life-size magnification is ideal for macro shooting. A Floating Focus System benefits close-up work by using two distinct focusing groups in order to maintain image quality throughout the focus range, and a linear motor ensures quick, quiet autofocus performance. Additionally, a five stop-effective optical image stabilization system complements making sharp imagery by minimizing the appearance of camera shake. In regard to the optical design, this lens employs one aspherical element and four low dispersion elements to realize sharp, clear imagery void of both chromatic and spherical aberrations. A Super EBC coating has also been applied to suppress flare and ghosting when working in bright and backlit conditions. Additionally, enabling the lens's use in harsh environments, it is weather-sealed and also features a fluorine coating on the front element to guard against moisture, smudging, and dust. Key Features Short telephoto prime lens is designed for APS-C-format FUJIFILM X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides a 122mm equivalent focal length. Macro lens affords a life-size 1:1 magnification ratio along with a 9.8\" minimum focusing distance for working with close-up subjects. Four extra-low dispersion elements, including one Super ED element, are used to greatly reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to produce high clarity and color fidelity. One aspherical element controls distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations, which helps to improve sharpness and realize more accurate rendering. Super EBC coating has been applied to individual elements to reduce lens flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Floating Focus System employs two distinct groups of focusing elements for faster performance as maintained image quality throughout the focusing range. Linear motor autofocus system delivers smooth, near-silent performance that is especially beneficial to video applications and when working in noise-sensitive areas. Focus range limiter switch allows you to constrain the focus range to between 9.8\" to 1.6', 1.6' to infinity, or for the whole 9.8\" to infinity range for more responsive focusing depending on the distance to your subject. A five stop-effective optical image stabilization system minimizes the appearance of camera shake for sharper handheld shooting in low-light conditions and with slower shutter speeds. The lens body is weather-sealed to protect against dust and moisture, and to enable worry-free use in inclement conditions. Additionally, this design also permits working in temperatures as low as 14°F. A fluorine coating has been applied to the front lens element to guard against smudging, moisture, and dust. Rounded nine-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing bokeh quality. Compatible with optional XF 1.4x TC WR and XF 2x TC WR teleconverters for extending the effective focal length to an equivalent 171mm and 244mm, respectively.

Ethernet switches create separate collision domains per switch port, allowing for simultaneous data transfers to occur without interference. They also reduce the number of broadcast domains, and don't require heavy CPU usage. The Ethernet switch manages the flow of network traffic more efficiently and in a safer manner than repeater hubs. It allows for the flow of data between connected devices. Ethernet switches come in both managed and unmanaged varieties. Unmanaged switches are the easy to install, plug and play variety.

COL title VAL SEIKO PRESAGE AUTOMATIC ZEN GARDEN - SRPD41J1 COL description VAL Back in 2010, a Seiko mechanical watch inspired by the glamour of the cocktail bar and designed especially for the Japanese market started to attract attention on the world's watch blogs, forums, and websites. In the months and years that followed, the watch became famous, and it has come to be coveted by Seiko fans all over the world. Today, we offer a series in our all-mechanical Presage collection that is based on this watch. In doing so, we bow delightedly to the wishes of Seiko enthusiasts, and we raise our grateful cocktail glasses to them all.At Baselworld 2019 Seiko introduced the Zen Garden range of Presage models with textured patterned dials that drew their inspiration from traditional Japanese gardens. The simple and serene design cues from traditional gardens are reflected in a series of five new models being added to the Presage line.Two models utilize the 4R57 calibre and come in either a silver dial with the SSA395J1 or a green dial on the SSA397J1. The dials are textured and this contrasts with the date sub-dial and power reserve gauge.The other models are the white & blue dialled SRPD39J1 & SRPD41J1 in a stainless steel case or the white dialed SRPD42J1 that comes in a rose gold colored case.

Benefits at a Glance:Ubiquinol CoQ10 absorbs up to 8 times better than ubiquinone CoQ10Promotes cellular energy production in heart, brain and muscle tissueProvides superior cardiovascular and antioxidant supportPrimaVie® shilajit enhances mitochondrial CoQ10 absorptionCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level.1 Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain,2 liver, kidneys, and (most importantly) your heart.3,4CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins5 and mitochondrial DNA6 from oxidative damage.1 Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in your body deplete over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinol and shilajitThe traditional form of CoQ10, ubiquinone, is difficult for the body to absorb. But another form, ubiquinol, has been shown to absorb up to 8 times greater than ubiquinone. That’s why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system with superior absorption levels.11Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie® shilajit is an adaptogen shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP — the main source of cellular energy.12-17 When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, it has been clinically shown to double levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.18 Shilajit prolongs CoQ10’s efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form19,20 and facilitates greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.12-17In middle-aged mice, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared to ubiquinone.21 In another preliminary study in mice, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain — 40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.22Breakthrough longevity and cellular energy formulaResearch supports the value of this unique combination of ubiquinol CoQ10 and shilajit. That’s why we’ve created Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™, to create a powerful synergy that supports heart health and youthful cellular energy production better than CoQ10 alone.For younger consumers or people with no known heart health issues, we recommend a daily CoQ10 supplement with at least 100 mg of ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10. For older customers or those with heart health concerns, we recommend 200 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per day. We also offer 50 mg CoQ10 supplements for those who wish to take a lower dose or who wish to spread their CoQ10 intake throughout the day. This supplement contains 50 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per softgel.Ratings based on results of the 2019 ConsumerLab.com Survey of Supplement Users. www.consumerlab.com/survey2019.Supplement FactsServing Size 1 softgelAmount Per ServingUbiquinol (as Kaneka Ubiquinol™)50 mgPrimaVie® Shilajit fulvic acid complex50 mgOther ingredients: sunflower oil, gelatin, glycerin, purified water, beeswax, sunflower lecithin, annatto color.Non-GMOPrimaVie® is a registered trademark of Natreon, Inc.Q+®, Kaneka Ubiquinol™, and the quality seal™ are registered or pending trademarks of Kaneka Corp.Dosage and UseTake one (1) softgel once or twice daily with food, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner.WarningsKEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDRENDO NOT EXCEED RECOMMENDED DOSEDo not purchase if outer seal is broken or damaged.When using nutritional supplements, please consult with your physician if you are undergoing treatment for a medical condition or if you are pregnant or lactating.To report a serious adverse event or obtain product information, contact 1-866-280-2852.Dosage and UseTake one (1) softgel once or twice daily with food, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner.These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.This product is not for use by or sale to persons under the age of 18.

COL title VAL FUJIFILM Aspherical Super EBC XF 80mm f/2.8 R LM OIS WR Macro Lens COL description VAL The FUJIFILM Aspherical Super EBC XF 80mm f/2.8 R LM OIS WR Macro Lens s a 122mm equivalent telephoto prime for X-mount mirrorless cameras. The long focal length coupled with the f/2.8 maximum aperture is well-suited to isolating subject matter, especially when paired with the short 9.8\" minimum focusing distance, and a 1:1 life-size magnification is ideal for macro shooting. A Floating Focus System benefits close-up work by using two distinct focusing groups in order to maintain image quality throughout the focus range, and a linear motor ensures quick, quiet autofocus performance. Additionally, a five stop-effective optical image stabilization system complements making sharp imagery by minimizing the appearance of camera shake. In regard to the optical design, this lens employs one aspherical element and four low dispersion elements to realize sharp, clear imagery void of both chromatic and spherical aberrations. A Super EBC coating has also been applied to suppress flare and ghosting when working in bright and backlit conditions. Additionally, enabling the lens's use in harsh environments, it is weather-sealed and also features a fluorine coating on the front element to guard against moisture, smudging, and dust. Key Features Short telephoto prime lens is designed for APS-C-format FUJIFILM X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides a 122mm equivalent focal length. Macro lens affords a life-size 1:1 magnification ratio along with a 9.8\" minimum focusing distance for working with close-up subjects. Four extra-low dispersion elements, including one Super ED element, are used to greatly reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to produce high clarity and color fidelity. One aspherical element controls distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations, which helps to improve sharpness and realize more accurate rendering. Super EBC coating has been applied to individual elements to reduce lens flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Floating Focus System employs two distinct groups of focusing elements for faster performance as maintained image quality throughout the focusing range. Linear motor autofocus system delivers smooth, near-silent performance that is especially beneficial to video applications and when working in noise-sensitive areas. Focus range limiter switch allows you to constrain the focus range to between 9.8\" to 1.6', 1.6' to infinity, or for the whole 9.8\" to infinity range for more responsive focusing depending on the distance to your subject. A five stop-effective optical image stabilization system minimizes the appearance of camera shake for sharper handheld shooting in low-light conditions and with slower shutter speeds. The lens body is weather-sealed to protect against dust and moisture, and to enable worry-free use in inclement conditions. Additionally, this design also permits working in temperatures as low as 14°F. A fluorine coating has been applied to the front lens element to guard against smudging, moisture, and dust. Rounded nine-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing bokeh quality. Compatible with optional XF 1.4x TC WR and XF 2x TC WR teleconverters for extending the effective focal length to an equivalent 171mm and 244mm, respectively.

COL title VAL Sony 35mm f2.8 Sonnar T* FE ZA Lens (SEL35F28Z) COL description VAL E-Mount Lens/Full-Frame FormatAperture Range: f/2.8 to f/22Three Double-Sided Aspherical ElementsZeiss T* Anti-Reflective CoatingLinear Autofocus Motor; Internal FocusMinimum Focus Distance: 13.8\"Dust and Moisture-Resistant ConstructionSeven-Blade Circular DiaphragmPerfect performance for the α7 seriesThe handling and convenience of this compact 35mm lens are enhanced by an internal focus mechanism that keeps its length constant during focusing. Lightweight design further augments portability as well as handling. All of this plus outstanding ZEISS resolution and contrast make this lens an ideal match for full-frame α7 series bodies.ZEISS resolution from corner to cornerOutstanding resolution and contrast are the key features of this lens. Three double-sided aspherical elements effectively control spherical aberration, while extensive application of the ZEISS T* coating not only minimizes flare and ghosting for natural colour reproduction, but is instrumental in achieving impressive contrast as well.Beautiful bokeh and low light performanceA maximum aperture of F2.8 facilitates shooting in a wide range of lighting conditions, with consistent image quality at all apertures. Bright lenses are often large, but a new focus lens group design allows a large maximum aperture in a compact lens. A circular aperture design contributes to gorgeous bokeh for smoothly defocused backgrounds.Shoot with confidence anywhereSome of the most exciting images are captured in challenging environments. A dust and moisture resistant design means that the lens will continue to perform reliably in moderately wet or dusty conditions, so you can shoot with confidence wherever those great shots are found.Outstanding colour and contrastThe ZEISS T* coating is an important contributing factor, effectively suppressing spurious reflections that can degrade overall image quality. Flare and ghosting are reduced for enhanced colour and contrast that give images a deep, three-dimensional feel.7-bladed circular apertureThe 7-blade circular makes it possible to achieve smoother, more natural defocusing in your images. Get creative with artistic blurring or 'bokeh' – and greater control over the depth of field.Supplied dedicated hood matches the lens’ compact formThe supplied ALC-SH129 is a cap type lens hood. This design is a perfect match for the compact lens barrel, contributing to both portability and protection. A filter thread is provided in the lens hood itself, allowing 40.5mm filters to be attached while the lens hood is in use.

That puts Mavic Mini in the safest drone category, which in many areas exempts it from regulations that apply to other, heavier drones. Drone pilots must always understand and follow local laws and regulations.An Optimal Flight ExperienceCreated to be the drone for everyone, even those new to drones, Mavic Mini is simple to operate and fly using the dedicated remote controller. The ultra-light design and high-grade motors provide Mavic Mini with up to 30 minutes of flight time, giving users with more time to explore and capture content. A Wi-Fi transmission signal[1] delivers stable control and an HD live feed for a clear, confident flying experience. GPS receivers and downward visual sensors detect the ground below Mavic Mini, enabling precise hovering, stable flying and accurate landing both indoors and out.Advanced Features Created to InspireThe new DJI Fly app is intuitively designed, simplifying the flying and content capturing experience so that pilots of all skill levels can make the most of Mavic Mini. Dedicated tutorials are included to help new pilots learn about flying, and pre-set editing templates add a new level of creativity to the footage. New pilots can choose to fly in Position (P) mode for basic operation, more experienced pilots can unlock more capabilities in Sport (S) mode, and content creators can choose CineSmooth (C) mode to lengthen braking time for smoother shots and more cinematic footage. Pilots can also choose from several pre-programmed flight maneuvers known as QuickShots. COL price VAL 4.99E2 COL priceCurrency VAL USD	0

The Dissector center knobs are all heavily ramped to minimize drag but retain sharp flat edges along their backs to provide strong braking traction. Small sipes give the knobs additional flexion increasing their surface area during braking and aiding the transition to the edge blocks when cornering. A distinct channel along either side of the center knobs – along with ample spacing between all lugs – helps to clear debris.Recommended as a rear tire TECH SPECSISO Diameter 622 / road / 29"Tire Diameter 29"Weight 861Color BlackTire Intended Use MountainISO Width (mm) 61TPI 60Tire Bead FoldingPSI 50Tire Type Tubeless Ready ClincherDefined Color BlackLabeled Size 29 x 2.4 COL price VAL 68.00 COL priceCurrency VAL USD	0

Differentiating itself from FUJIFILM's other XF 56mm f/1.2 lens, this APD version incorporates an apodization filter to produce an aesthetically-pleasing out-of-focus quality to suit selective focus applications. Complementing the unique bokeh-related attributes of the lens is an equally sophisticated optical design, which features both aspherical and extra-low dispersion elements to help reduce a variety of aberrations, color fringing, and distortion. A Super EBC coating is used, too, to reduce flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color accuracy in bright and backlit conditions. Additionally, this lens also features an internal focusing mechanism for quick focusing performance along with a rounded seven-blade diaphragm to further contribute to a pleasing bokeh quality. Key Features Prime portrait-length lens is designed for APS-C-format Fujifilm X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides an 85mm equivalent focal length. Especially bright f/1.2 maximum aperture excels in low-light conditions and also offers notable control over depth of field for using selective focus techniques. Signified by the APD designation, this lens incorporates an apodization filter in order to produce controllable and aesthetically-pleasing bokeh, which is characterized by sharp main subjects, tremendously blurred background, and an overall three-dimensional quality. Since the apodization filter performs best at wider aperture values, a 3-stop ND filter is built into the lens to aid in controlling exposure. Using two separate sets of aperture values, the red series of numbers indicates the effective aperture value as it relates to depth of field. The standard white set of numbers indicates the actual f/stop number, and the difference between these two sets of numbers indicates the effectiveness of the filter. One double-sided aspherical element limits distortion and spherical aberration in order to realize greater sharpness and accurate rendering. Two extra-low dispersion elements reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to provide greater clarity and color accuracy. Super EBC coating has been applied to individual elements to reduce lens flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Internal focusing design affords fast and quiet autofocus performance that benefits both stills and video applications. Rounded seven-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing out-of-focus quality to benefit the use of selective focus and shallow depth of field techniques.

COL title VAL Sony 35mm f2.8 Sonnar T* FE ZA Lens (SEL35F28Z) COL description VAL E-Mount Lens/Full-Frame FormatAperture Range: f/2.8 to f/22Three Double-Sided Aspherical ElementsZeiss T* Anti-Reflective CoatingLinear Autofocus Motor; Internal FocusMinimum Focus Distance: 13.8\"Dust and Moisture-Resistant ConstructionSeven-Blade Circular DiaphragmPerfect performance for the α7 seriesThe handling and convenience of this compact 35mm lens are enhanced by an internal focus mechanism that keeps its length constant during focusing. Lightweight design further augments portability as well as handling. All of this plus outstanding ZEISS resolution and contrast make this lens an ideal match for full-frame α7 series bodies.ZEISS resolution from corner to cornerOutstanding resolution and contrast are the key features of this lens. Three double-sided aspherical elements effectively control spherical aberration, while extensive application of the ZEISS T* coating not only minimizes flare and ghosting for natural colour reproduction, but is instrumental in achieving impressive contrast as well.Beautiful bokeh and low light performanceA maximum aperture of F2.8 facilitates shooting in a wide range of lighting conditions, with consistent image quality at all apertures. Bright lenses are often large, but a new focus lens group design allows a large maximum aperture in a compact lens. A circular aperture design contributes to gorgeous bokeh for smoothly defocused backgrounds.Shoot with confidence anywhereSome of the most exciting images are captured in challenging environments. A dust and moisture resistant design means that the lens will continue to perform reliably in moderately wet or dusty conditions, so you can shoot with confidence wherever those great shots are found.Outstanding colour and contrastThe ZEISS T* coating is an important contributing factor, effectively suppressing spurious reflections that can degrade overall image quality. Flare and ghosting are reduced for enhanced colour and contrast that give images a deep, three-dimensional feel.7-bladed circular apertureThe 7-blade circular makes it possible to achieve smoother, more natural defocusing in your images. Get creative with artistic blurring or 'bokeh' – and greater control over the depth of field.Supplied dedicated hood matches the lens’ compact formThe supplied ALC-SH129 is a cap type lens hood. This design is a perfect match for the compact lens barrel, contributing to both portability and protection. A filter thread is provided in the lens hood itself, allowing 40.5mm filters to be attached while the lens hood is in use.

It is the perfect choice to improve the performance of Offices and workgroup networks.Key Features24x Gigabit Ethernet 10/100/1000M RJ45 ports.All ports support Full/half duplex transfer mode for 10Mbps/100Mbps and Full duplex transfer mode for 1000MbpsSupports Auto-MDI/MDIX functionSupports IEEE 802.3X flow control for full-duplex mode and back pressure flow control for half-duplex modeStore and forward Switching schemeStandard 19-inch rack-mountable steel caseGigabit SwitchFeatured with 24 10/100/1000Mbps ports, TP-Link TL-SG1024 Switch greatly expands your network capacity, enabling instant large files transferring. So power users in the home, office, workgroup, or creative production environment can now move large, bandwidth-intensive files faster. Transfer graphics, CGI, CAD, or multimedia files across the network instantly.Go Green With Your EthernetYou now have the choice to go green when upgrading to a gigabit network! This new generation TP-Link TL-SG1024 24-Port Gigabit Switch features the latest innovative energy-efficient technologies that can greatly expand your network capacity with much less power*. It automatically adjusts power consumption according to the link status and cable length to limit the carbon footprint of your network.Power down Idle PortsWhen a computer or network equipment is off, the corresponding port of a traditional switch will continue to consume considerable amounts of power. The TP-Link TL-SG1024 can automatically detect the link status of each port and reduce the power consumption of ports that are idle.Power Budget According to Cable LengthIdeally, shorter cables would use less power because of less power degradation over their length, this is not the case with most devices as they will use the same amount of power across the cable regardless of whether it is 10 or 50 meters in length. The TP-Link TL-SG1024 analyses the length of the Ethernet cable connected and adjusts the power usage accordingly, rather than keeping the power consumption in a conventional solution.Easy to UseThe TP-Link TL-SG1024 auto features of this gigabit switch make installation plug and play and hassle-free. No configuring is required. Auto MDI/MDIX eliminates the need for crossover cables. Auto-negotiation on each port senses the link speed of a network device (either 10, 100 Mbps or 1000 Mbps) and intelligently adjusts for compatibility and optimal performance.Standard Warranty: Limited LifetimeSpecificationStandards and ProtocolsIEEE802.3, 802.3u, 802.3ab, 802.3x CSMA/CD, TCP/IPBasic FunctionWire-speed PerformanceMAC Address Auto-Learning and Auto-agingIEEE802.3x flow control for Full-Duplex Mode and backpressure for Half-Duplex ModeBackbound Bandwidth48GbpsMAC Address Table8kForwarding Rate10BASE-T: 14880pps/port100BASE-TX: 148800pps/port1000BASE-T: 1488000pps/portTransmission MethodStore-and-ForwardPorts24 10/100/1000Mbps Auto-Negotiation RJ45 ports (Auto MDI/MDIX)Network Media10Base-T: UTP category 3, 4, 5 cable (maximum 100m)EIA/TIA-568 100Ù STP (maximum 100m)100Base-Tx: UTP category 5, 5e cable (maximum 100m)EIA/TIA-568 100Ù STP (maximum 100m)1000Base-T: UTP category 5, 5e cable (maximum 100m)LED IndicatorsPower, Link/ActSafety & EmissionFCC, CEDimensions (WxDxH)17.3 x 7.1 x 1.7 in.

The long focal length coupled with the f/2.8 maximum aperture is well-suited to isolating subject matter, especially when paired with the short 9.8\" minimum focusing distance, and a 1:1 life-size magnification is ideal for macro shooting. A Floating Focus System benefits close-up work by using two distinct focusing groups in order to maintain image quality throughout the focus range, and a linear motor ensures quick, quiet autofocus performance. Additionally, a five stop-effective optical image stabilization system complements making sharp imagery by minimizing the appearance of camera shake. In regard to the optical design, this lens employs one aspherical element and four low dispersion elements to realize sharp, clear imagery void of both chromatic and spherical aberrations. A Super EBC coating has also been applied to suppress flare and ghosting when working in bright and backlit conditions. Additionally, enabling the lens's use in harsh environments, it is weather-sealed and also features a fluorine coating on the front element to guard against moisture, smudging, and dust. Key Features Short telephoto prime lens is designed for APS-C-format FUJIFILM X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides a 122mm equivalent focal length. Macro lens affords a life-size 1:1 magnification ratio along with a 9.8\" minimum focusing distance for working with close-up subjects. Four extra-low dispersion elements, including one Super ED element, are used to greatly reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to produce high clarity and color fidelity. One aspherical element controls distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations, which helps to improve sharpness and realize more accurate rendering. Super EBC coating has been applied to individual elements to reduce lens flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Floating Focus System employs two distinct groups of focusing elements for faster performance as maintained image quality throughout the focusing range. Linear motor autofocus system delivers smooth, near-silent performance that is especially beneficial to video applications and when working in noise-sensitive areas. Focus range limiter switch allows you to constrain the focus range to between 9.8\" to 1.6', 1.6' to infinity, or for the whole 9.8\" to infinity range for more responsive focusing depending on the distance to your subject. A five stop-effective optical image stabilization system minimizes the appearance of camera shake for sharper handheld shooting in low-light conditions and with slower shutter speeds. The lens body is weather-sealed to protect against dust and moisture, and to enable worry-free use in inclement conditions. Additionally, this design also permits working in temperatures as low as 14°F. A fluorine coating has been applied to the front lens element to guard against smudging, moisture, and dust. Rounded nine-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing bokeh quality. Compatible with optional XF 1.4x TC WR and XF 2x TC WR teleconverters for extending the effective focal length to an equivalent 171mm and 244mm, respectively.

The 502AH features a flat base and 15.5 lb payload, and the tripod offers a max height of 67\" with the center column raised. The standard max height is 55\".Manfrotto 502AH Pro Video Head with Flat BaseThe Manfrotto 502AH Pro Video Head with Flat Base is an affordable yet remarkably fully featured professional head that represents an advance over the popular 501HDV, with sturdier construction and featuring Manfrotto's patented bridging technology (inherited from the 509 and 504 heads). This head is designed for executing cinematic moves with compact camcorders and DSLR video cameras. The 502AH comes in two versions—the \"AH\" flat-base version such as this, and the \"A\" ball base version which is separately available.The weight capacity is 15.4 lb and counterbalance supports 8.8 lb. The balance plate's 3.27\" range allows you to correct for uneven payloads due to matte boxes or DSLR rig configurations.The bridging technology ensures that the pan friction control is intuitive and easy to set, but also protected against knocks. There are independent locks for pan and tilt, and drag for both is selectable in a continuous range from zero to the max level. This allows you to operate the head in a confident, smooth manner using the included pan bar.Pan drag and tilt drag are continuously adjustable from 0 (no drag) to the maximum levelSliding quick release plate secured by secondary safety systemUPC: 719821334651Manfrotto MT055XPRO3 Aluminum TripodThe Manfrotto MT055XPRO3 Aluminum Tripod is a three-section support that replaces the 055XPROB tripod. It has a load capacity of 19.8 lb and extends from 3.5\" to 66.9\". Its legs are secured by the Quick Power Locks. These updated flip locks increase the tripod's rigidity by 50%, and its load capacity by 4.4 lb over its predecessor.A redesigned center column has a \"one finger\" operation, and includes an Easy Link attachment for attaching accessories such as an LED light or a reflector. The center column can be positioned horizontally, allowing for low-angle and macro photography. The upper disc where a tripod head is mounted has been redesigned as well, and now has a bull's eye bubble level that rotates 360° so you can locate it where you can see it.

It is made of aluminum alloy and reaches a maximum height of 59.1\" with its column extended, folding down to 15.7\" in length for simplified transport in its included carrying case.Each leg of the Befree Advanced is composed of four sections, which can be adjusted and securely locked into place with the QPL lever locks found on all segments. A side-pull selector allows you to set up the tripod at three different angle configurations, enabling low angle shooting with the simple push of a button. Complementing the legs is an equally sturdy center ball head, which offers a dedicated knob for panoramic movement as well as a friction control knob for precise control over the tension during use.The final element is a dedicated 200PL-Pro quick release plate, which is made specifically for the Sony a7 and a9 series mirrorless cameras. It is bright orange to match the body details and offers dual compatibility for RC2 and Arca-type quick release systems. As the plate is specially designed and has an anti-twist lip, please note that other non-Sony equipment may not fit on it adequately.An Easy Link attachment is available at the top portion of the leg section, and allows you to connect compatible accessories such as flashes or reflectors. This enables you to use the tripod as a support system and reduce the amount of gear you need to carry while travelling. Rubberized feet are used to avoid skidding and help keep the Befree Advanced stable in most types of terrain. Finally, an integrated hook found at the bottom can be used to add a weight and increase the stability of your tripod when shooting in more difficult conditions.Designed for the Sony a7 and a9 series cameras, with a matching black and orange color pattern and specially designed QR plateWeighs 3.6 lb, can hold up to 17.6 lb of gearFour leg sections which extend and fasten via its lever locksMaximum height of 59.1\", folds down to 15.7\" in length for storageAluminum-alloy constructionSide button allows you to select between three different leg anglesBall head with separate pan lock and friction control knobsQuick release plate designed to fit the Sony Alpha a7 and a9 cameras, and compatible with both RC2 and Arca-type systemsRubberized feet provide increased stability on most surfacesEasy Link attachment for use with optional accessoriesIntegrated hook for weighing down and stabilizing tripod during useSPECIFICATIONSSpecificationsTripod HeadHead TypeBall HeadCamera Mounting Screw1/4\"-20 MaleQuick Release Plate Type200PL Pan & Tilt RangeLateral Tilt-90° to +40°Vertical Tilt-90° to +40°GeneralLoad Capacity17.6lb / 8kgMaximum Working Height59.1\" / 150cmMax Height without Center Column52.4\" / 133cmFolded Length15.7\" / 40cmWeight3.6lb / 1.6kgLegsLeg Lock TypeFlip LockTripod Feet FeaturesRubber Center ColumnCenter Column FeaturesBallast Hook COL price VAL 4995.0 COL priceCurrency VAL ZAR	0

But another form, ubiquinol, has been shown to absorb up to 8 times greater than ubiquinone. That’s why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system with superior absorption levels.11Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie® shilajit is an adaptogen shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP — the main source of cellular energy.12-17 When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, it has been clinically shown to double levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.18 Shilajit prolongs CoQ10’s efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form19,20 and facilitates greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.12-17In middle-aged mice, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared to ubiquinone.21 In another preliminary study in mice, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain — 40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.22Breakthrough longevity and cellular energy formulaResearch supports the value of this unique combination of ubiquinol CoQ10 and shilajit. That’s why we’ve created Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™, to create a powerful synergy that supports heart health and youthful cellular energy production better than CoQ10 alone.For younger consumers or people with no known heart health issues, we recommend a daily CoQ10 supplement with at least 100 mg of ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10. For older customers or those with heart health concerns, we recommend 200 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per day. We also offer 50 mg CoQ10 supplements for those who wish to take a lower dose or who wish to spread their CoQ10 intake throughout the day. This supplement contains 50 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per softgel.Ratings based on results of the 2019 ConsumerLab.com Survey of Supplement Users. www.consumerlab.com/survey2019.Supplement FactsServing Size 1 softgelAmount Per ServingUbiquinol (as Kaneka Ubiquinol™)50 mgPrimaVie® Shilajit fulvic acid complex50 mgOther ingredients: sunflower oil, gelatin, glycerin, purified water, beeswax, sunflower lecithin, annatto color.Non-GMOPrimaVie® is a registered trademark of Natreon, Inc.Q+®, Kaneka Ubiquinol™, and the quality seal™ are registered or pending trademarks of Kaneka Corp.Dosage and UseTake one (1) softgel once or twice daily with food, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner.WarningsKEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDRENDO NOT EXCEED RECOMMENDED DOSEDo not purchase if outer seal is broken or damaged.When using nutritional supplements, please consult with your physician if you are undergoing treatment for a medical condition or if you are pregnant or lactating.To report a serious adverse event or obtain product information, contact 1-866-280-2852.Dosage and UseTake one (1) softgel once or twice daily with food, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner.These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.This product is not for use by or sale to persons under the age of 18.

That’s why CoQ10 is also highly concentrated in your brain, liver and kidneys.CoQ10 Benefits Promotes cellular energy production, especially in the high-energy organs such as the brain, the liver, kidneys & the heartContains ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10 augmented with PrimaVie® shilajit to promote mitochondrial CoQ10 absorption to support greater cellular energy outputProvides powerful cardiovascular & antioxidant supportOffers a way to offset natural CoQ10 depletion over timeCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level. Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain, liver, kidneys and your heart.CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins and mitochondrial DNA from oxidative damage. Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in the body decrease over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinolThe traditional ubiquinone form of CoQ10 is difficult for the body to absorb. That's why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system shown to absorb up to 8 times better than ubiquinone. In people taking this form of ubiquinol, high levels of plasma CoQ10 can be achieved in only four weeks.Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie® shilajit has been shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main source of cellular energy. When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, shilajit doubles levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.Shilajit prolongs CoQ10's efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form and promotes greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.CoQ10 and agingIn a pre-clinical model, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared with ubiquinone. In another pre-clinical study, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain—40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.Do your part for a healthy heart Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is a powerful formula for heart health and youthful cellular energy support.

COL title VAL TP-LINK TL-SG1024 24-Port Unmanaged Gigabit Switch COL description VAL DescriptionThe TP-Link TL-SG1024 is specially designed for Ethernet (10Mbps), Fast Ethernet (100Mbps) and Gigabit Ethernet (1000Mbps) with seamless link. Each port supports up to 2000Mbps throughput in full duplex mode. It is the perfect choice to improve the performance of Offices and workgroup networks.Key Features24x Gigabit Ethernet 10/100/1000M RJ45 ports.All ports support Full/half duplex transfer mode for 10Mbps/100Mbps and Full duplex transfer mode for 1000MbpsSupports Auto-MDI/MDIX functionSupports IEEE 802.3X flow control for full-duplex mode and back pressure flow control for half-duplex modeStore and forward Switching schemeStandard 19-inch rack-mountable steel caseGigabit SwitchFeatured with 24 10/100/1000Mbps ports, TP-Link TL-SG1024 Switch greatly expands your network capacity, enabling instant large files transferring. So power users in the home, office, workgroup, or creative production environment can now move large, bandwidth-intensive files faster. Transfer graphics, CGI, CAD, or multimedia files across the network instantly.Go Green With Your EthernetYou now have the choice to go green when upgrading to a gigabit network! This new generation TP-Link TL-SG1024 24-Port Gigabit Switch features the latest innovative energy-efficient technologies that can greatly expand your network capacity with much less power*. It automatically adjusts power consumption according to the link status and cable length to limit the carbon footprint of your network.Power down Idle PortsWhen a computer or network equipment is off, the corresponding port of a traditional switch will continue to consume considerable amounts of power. The TP-Link TL-SG1024 can automatically detect the link status of each port and reduce the power consumption of ports that are idle.Power Budget According to Cable LengthIdeally, shorter cables would use less power because of less power degradation over their length, this is not the case with most devices as they will use the same amount of power across the cable regardless of whether it is 10 or 50 meters in length. The TP-Link TL-SG1024 analyses the length of the Ethernet cable connected and adjusts the power usage accordingly, rather than keeping the power consumption in a conventional solution.Easy to UseThe TP-Link TL-SG1024 auto features of this gigabit switch make installation plug and play and hassle-free. No configuring is required. Auto MDI/MDIX eliminates the need for crossover cables. Auto-negotiation on each port senses the link speed of a network device (either 10, 100 Mbps or 1000 Mbps) and intelligently adjusts for compatibility and optimal performance.Standard Warranty: Limited LifetimeSpecificationStandards and ProtocolsIEEE802.3, 802.3u, 802.3ab, 802.3x CSMA/CD, TCP/IPBasic FunctionWire-speed PerformanceMAC Address Auto-Learning and Auto-agingIEEE802.3x flow control for Full-Duplex Mode and backpressure for Half-Duplex ModeBackbound Bandwidth48GbpsMAC Address Table8kForwarding Rate10BASE-T: 14880pps/port100BASE-TX: 148800pps/port1000BASE-T: 1488000pps/portTransmission MethodStore-and-ForwardPorts24 10/100/1000Mbps Auto-Negotiation RJ45 ports (Auto MDI/MDIX)Network Media10Base-T: UTP category 3, 4, 5 cable (maximum 100m)EIA/TIA-568 100Ù STP (maximum 100m)100Base-Tx: UTP category 5, 5e cable (maximum 100m)EIA/TIA-568 100Ù STP (maximum 100m)1000Base-T: UTP category 5, 5e cable (maximum 100m)LED IndicatorsPower, Link/ActSafety & EmissionFCC, CEDimensions (WxDxH)17.3 x 7.1 x 1.7 in.

Mitochondria are considered the main energy producers in human cells. CoQ10 plays a key role in transforming the body's fat and sugar reserves into energy fuel. However, the healthy supply of CoQ10 diminishes as we grow older.It is important to keep adequate levels of CoQ10 to help in the proper functioning of the mitochondria, especially in its ability to accommodate cell energy production in the most vital systems of the body such as the heart. CoQ10 also exhibits strong antioxidant properties that help fight not only the harmful effects of free radicals, but also from LDL and DNA oxidation.Life Extension Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support contains a potent combination of highly absorbable CoQ10 compounds with shilajit, which together produces an unique synergistic effect for healthy cellular energy production.

COL title VAL FUJIFILM Fujinon XF 56mm f/1.2 R APD Lens COL description VAL The FUJIFILM Fujinon XF 56mm f/1.2 R APD Lens features a unique optical design, flattering portrait-length field of view, and an especially fast f/1.2 maximum aperture. Differentiating itself from FUJIFILM's other XF 56mm f/1.2 lens, this APD version incorporates an apodization filter to produce an aesthetically-pleasing out-of-focus quality to suit selective focus applications. Complementing the unique bokeh-related attributes of the lens is an equally sophisticated optical design, which features both aspherical and extra-low dispersion elements to help reduce a variety of aberrations, color fringing, and distortion. A Super EBC coating is used, too, to reduce flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color accuracy in bright and backlit conditions. Additionally, this lens also features an internal focusing mechanism for quick focusing performance along with a rounded seven-blade diaphragm to further contribute to a pleasing bokeh quality. Key Features Prime portrait-length lens is designed for APS-C-format Fujifilm X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides an 85mm equivalent focal length. Especially bright f/1.2 maximum aperture excels in low-light conditions and also offers notable control over depth of field for using selective focus techniques. Signified by the APD designation, this lens incorporates an apodization filter in order to produce controllable and aesthetically-pleasing bokeh, which is characterized by sharp main subjects, tremendously blurred background, and an overall three-dimensional quality. Since the apodization filter performs best at wider aperture values, a 3-stop ND filter is built into the lens to aid in controlling exposure. Using two separate sets of aperture values, the red series of numbers indicates the effective aperture value as it relates to depth of field. The standard white set of numbers indicates the actual f/stop number, and the difference between these two sets of numbers indicates the effectiveness of the filter. One double-sided aspherical element limits distortion and spherical aberration in order to realize greater sharpness and accurate rendering. Two extra-low dispersion elements reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to provide greater clarity and color accuracy. Super EBC coating has been applied to individual elements to reduce lens flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Internal focusing design affords fast and quiet autofocus performance that benefits both stills and video applications. Rounded seven-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing out-of-focus quality to benefit the use of selective focus and shallow depth of field techniques.

FUJIFILM XF 8-16mm f/2.8 R LM WR Lens features a constant f/2.8 maximum aperture for consistent performance throughout the zoom range. The optical layout comprises six extra-low dispersion elements, including three Super ED elements, which help to virtually eliminate chromatic aberrations and color fringing for greater clarity and color accuracy. Four aspherical elements are also used to suppress distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations for improved sharpness. Also, a Nano-GI coating helps to control ghosting and flare for enhanced contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Complementing the optics is a refined linear motor, which affords quick and quiet autofocus performance, and the lens body is weather-sealed in 11 distinct places to support working in trying environmental conditions. Impressively wide zoom is designed for FUJIFILM X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides a 12-24mm equivalent focal length range. Constant f/2.8 maximum aperture offers consistent performance throughout the zoom range and excels when working in difficult lighting conditions. Six extra-low dispersion elements, including three Super ED elements, are used to greatly reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to produce high clarity and color fidelity throughout the zoom range. Four aspherical elements control distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations, which helps to improve sharpness and realize more accurate rendering. Nano-GI (Gradient Index) coating has been applied to lens elements and alters the refractive index between the glass and air in order to better suppress lens flare and ghosting for diagonal incident light. Linear motor autofocus system delivers smooth, near-silent performance that is especially beneficial to video applications and when working in noise-sensitive areas. The lens body incorporates extensive weather sealing to protect against dust and moisture, and to enable worry-free use in inclement conditions and freezing temperatures as low as 14°F.

Mitochondria are considered the main energy producers in human cells. CoQ10 plays a key role in transforming the body's fat and sugar reserves into energy fuel. However, the healthy supply of CoQ10 diminishes as we grow older.It is important to keep adequate levels of CoQ10 to help in the proper functioning of the mitochondria, especially in its ability to accommodate cell energy production in the most vital systems of the body such as the heart. CoQ10 also exhibits strong antioxidant properties that help fight not only the harmful effects of free radicals, but also from LDL and DNA oxidation.Life Extension Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support contains a potent combination of highly absorbable CoQ10 compounds with shilajit, which together produces an unique synergistic effect for healthy cellular energy production.

That puts Mavic Mini in the safest drone category, which in many areas exempts it from regulations that apply to other, heavier drones. Drone pilots must always understand and follow local laws and regulations.An Optimal Flight ExperienceCreated to be the drone for everyone, even those new to drones, Mavic Mini is simple to operate and fly using the dedicated remote controller. The ultra-light design and high-grade motors provide Mavic Mini with up to 30 minutes of flight time, giving users with more time to explore and capture content. A Wi-Fi transmission signal[1] delivers stable control and an HD live feed for a clear, confident flying experience. GPS receivers and downward visual sensors detect the ground below Mavic Mini, enabling precise hovering, stable flying and accurate landing both indoors and out.Advanced Features Created to InspireThe new DJI Fly app is intuitively designed, simplifying the flying and content capturing experience so that pilots of all skill levels can make the most of Mavic Mini. Dedicated tutorials are included to help new pilots learn about flying, and pre-set editing templates add a new level of creativity to the footage. New pilots can choose to fly in Position (P) mode for basic operation, more experienced pilots can unlock more capabilities in Sport (S) mode, and content creators can choose CineSmooth (C) mode to lengthen braking time for smoother shots and more cinematic footage. Pilots can also choose from several pre-programmed flight maneuvers known as QuickShots. COL price VAL 4.99E2 COL priceCurrency VAL USD	0

COL title VAL Life Extension, Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support, 50 mg, 30 Softgels COL description VAL Enhanced Delivery System for Maximum AbsorptionDietary SupplementNon GMO LE CertifiedMade with Quality Kaneka UbiquinolCoQ10 promotes heart health and cellular energy production. Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is formulated with a highly bioavailable ubiquinol form of coenzyme Q10 and augmented with the adaptogen PrimaVie® shilajit, which is shown to further increase CoQ10 absorption, promote cardiovascular health and help promote youthful cellular energy production.Your heart cells need CoQ10—but so do your other organs. That’s why CoQ10 is also highly concentrated in your brain, liver and kidneys.CoQ10 Benefits Promotes cellular energy production, especially in the high-energy organs such as the brain, the liver, kidneys & the heartContains ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10 augmented with PrimaVie® shilajit to promote mitochondrial CoQ10 absorption to support greater cellular energy outputProvides powerful cardiovascular & antioxidant supportOffers a way to offset natural CoQ10 depletion over timeCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level. Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain, liver, kidneys and your heart.CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins and mitochondrial DNA from oxidative damage. Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in the body decrease over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinolThe traditional ubiquinone form of CoQ10 is difficult for the body to absorb. That's why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system shown to absorb up to 8 times better than ubiquinone. In people taking this form of ubiquinol, high levels of plasma CoQ10 can be achieved in only four weeks.Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie® shilajit has been shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main source of cellular energy. When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, shilajit doubles levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.Shilajit prolongs CoQ10's efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form and promotes greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.CoQ10 and agingIn a pre-clinical model, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared with ubiquinone. In another pre-clinical study, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain—40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.Do your part for a healthy heart Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is a powerful formula for heart health and youthful cellular energy support.

Ethernet switches create separate collision domains per switch port, allowing for simultaneous data transfers to occur without interference. They also reduce the number of broadcast domains, and don't require heavy CPU usage. The Ethernet switch manages the flow of network traffic more efficiently and in a safer manner than repeater hubs. It allows for the flow of data between connected devices. Ethernet switches come in both managed and unmanaged varieties. Unmanaged switches are the easy to install, plug and play variety.

Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is formulated with a highly bioavailable ubiquinol form of coenzyme Q10 and augmented with the adaptogen PrimaVie® shilajit, which is shown to further increase CoQ10 absorption, promote cardiovascular health and help promote youthful cellular energy production.Your heart cells need CoQ10—but so do your other organs. That’s why CoQ10 is also highly concentrated in your brain, liver and kidneys.CoQ10 Benefits Promotes cellular energy production, especially in the high-energy organs such as the brain, the liver, kidneys & the heartContains ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10 augmented with PrimaVie® shilajit to promote mitochondrial CoQ10 absorption to support greater cellular energy outputProvides powerful cardiovascular & antioxidant supportOffers a way to offset natural CoQ10 depletion over timeCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level. Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain, liver, kidneys and your heart.CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins and mitochondrial DNA from oxidative damage. Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in the body decrease over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinolThe traditional ubiquinone form of CoQ10 is difficult for the body to absorb. That's why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system shown to absorb up to 8 times better than ubiquinone. In people taking this form of ubiquinol, high levels of plasma CoQ10 can be achieved in only four weeks.Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie® shilajit has been shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main source of cellular energy. When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, shilajit doubles levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.Shilajit prolongs CoQ10's efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form and promotes greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.CoQ10 and agingIn a pre-clinical model, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared with ubiquinone. In another pre-clinical study, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain—40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.Do your part for a healthy heart Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is a powerful formula for heart health and youthful cellular energy support.

That’s why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system with superior absorption levels.11Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie® shilajit is an adaptogen shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP — the main source of cellular energy.12-17 When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, it has been clinically shown to double levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.18 Shilajit prolongs CoQ10’s efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form19,20 and facilitates greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.12-17In middle-aged mice, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared to ubiquinone.21 In another preliminary study in mice, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain — 40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.22Breakthrough longevity and cellular energy formulaResearch supports the value of this unique combination of ubiquinol CoQ10 and shilajit. That’s why we’ve created Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™, to create a powerful synergy that supports heart health and youthful cellular energy production better than CoQ10 alone.For younger consumers or people with no known heart health issues, we recommend a daily CoQ10 supplement with at least 100 mg of ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10. For older customers or those with heart health concerns, we recommend 200 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per day. We also offer 50 mg CoQ10 supplements for those who wish to take a lower dose or who wish to spread their CoQ10 intake throughout the day.

The camera features Smart Autotracking that is designed to automatically control the direction and zoom-level of the PTZ configurations of the camera for optimised camera view. This function may be used to provide automatic, visual confirmation of detected objects reducing the rate of false alarms and can also ensure that any potential intruder remains within the camera’s line of sight.The intuitive interface of the camera allows for quick and easy remote calibration to ensure that the camera’s settings are appropriately configured in view of its operation conditions and environment.The camera is ideally suited to deployment in demanding outdoor environments where pan/tilt/zoom functionality would be an advantage, such as perimeter surveillance and airports, roads, railways, squares, parks, scenic spots, and other open venues. Advanced gatekeeper technology can be configured to move the camera to a pre-set position upon triggering of an alarm event before returning the camera to a default position after a pre-configured interval, a useful feature for applications such as facial identification. As well as this, the camera has day/night functionality, providing a round-the-clock monitoring solution. During daylight hours, the camera provides a HD colour image, switching at night-time or during periods of very poor lighting conditions to an infrared-sensitive black and white image. High Power over Ethernet provides both power and network connectivity through one cable, simplifying installation, reducing costs and time. The powerful optical zoom lens enables the camera to cover in more details expansive areas with the ability to zoom on regions of interest.Key Features: 1/2.8" progressive scan CMOS Up to 1920 × 1080@30fps resolution Min. illumination: Colour: 0.005 Lux @(F1.6, AGC ON) B/W: 0.001 Lux @(F1.6, AGC ON) 0 Lux with IR 25× optical zoom, 16× digital zoom WDR, HLC, BLC, 3D DNR, Defog, EIS, Regional Exposure, Regional Focus Up to 150 m IR distance 24 VAC & Hi-PoE Support H.265+/H.265 video compression Audio input/output Alarm input/output COL price VAL 397 COL priceCurrency VAL GBP	COL title VAL Canon PGI-2555XXL Ink Tank Black COL price VAL 24.99 COL priceCurrency VAL CAD	0

COL title VAL Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ COL description VAL Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is formulated with ubiquinol, a highly bioavailable form of coenzyme Q10 nutrient, and augmented with the adaptogen PrimaVie® shilajit, clinically shown to further increase CoQ10 absorption, promote cardiovascular health, and help restore youthful cellular energy. Benefits at a Glance:Ubiquinol CoQ10 absorbs up to 8 times better than ubiquinone CoQ10Promotes cellular energy production in heart, brain and muscle tissueProvides superior cardiovascular and antioxidant supportPrimaVie® shilajit enhances mitochondrial CoQ10 absorptionCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level.1 Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain,2 liver, kidneys, and (most importantly) your heart.3,4CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins5 and mitochondrial DNA6 from oxidative damage.1 Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in your body deplete over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinol and shilajitThe traditional form of CoQ10, ubiquinone, is difficult for the body to absorb. But another form, ubiquinol, has been shown to absorb up to 8 times greater than ubiquinone. That’s why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system with superior absorption levels.11Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie® shilajit is an adaptogen shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP — the main source of cellular energy.12-17 When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, it has been clinically shown to double levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.18 Shilajit prolongs CoQ10’s efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form19,20 and facilitates greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.12-17In middle-aged mice, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared to ubiquinone.21 In another preliminary study in mice, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain — 40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.22Breakthrough longevity and cellular energy formulaResearch supports the value of this unique combination of ubiquinol CoQ10 and shilajit. That’s why we’ve created Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™, to create a powerful synergy that supports heart health and youthful cellular energy production better than CoQ10 alone.For younger consumers or people with no known heart health issues, we recommend a daily CoQ10 supplement with at least 100 mg of ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10. For older customers or those with heart health concerns, we recommend 200 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per day. We also offer 50 mg CoQ10 supplements for those who wish to take a lower dose or who wish to spread their CoQ10 intake throughout the day. This supplement contains 50 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per softgel.Ratings based on results of the 2019 ConsumerLab.com Survey of Supplement Users. www.consumerlab.com/survey2019.Supplement FactsServing Size 1 softgelAmount Per ServingUbiquinol (as Kaneka Ubiquinol™)50 mgPrimaVie® Shilajit fulvic acid complex50 mgOther ingredients: sunflower oil, gelatin, glycerin, purified water, beeswax, sunflower lecithin, annatto color.Non-GMOPrimaVie® is a registered trademark of Natreon, Inc.Q+®, Kaneka Ubiquinol™, and the quality seal™ are registered or pending trademarks of Kaneka Corp.Dosage and UseTake one (1) softgel once or twice daily with food, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner.WarningsKEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDRENDO NOT EXCEED RECOMMENDED DOSEDo not purchase if outer seal is broken or damaged.When using nutritional supplements, please consult with your physician if you are undergoing treatment for a medical condition or if you are pregnant or lactating.To report a serious adverse event or obtain product information, contact 1-866-280-2852.Dosage and UseTake one (1) softgel once or twice daily with food, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner.These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.This product is not for use by or sale to persons under the age of 18.

Three double-sided aspherical elements effectively control spherical aberration, while extensive application of the ZEISS T* coating not only minimizes flare and ghosting for natural colour reproduction, but is instrumental in achieving impressive contrast as well.Beautiful bokeh and low light performanceA maximum aperture of F2.8 facilitates shooting in a wide range of lighting conditions, with consistent image quality at all apertures. Bright lenses are often large, but a new focus lens group design allows a large maximum aperture in a compact lens. A circular aperture design contributes to gorgeous bokeh for smoothly defocused backgrounds.Shoot with confidence anywhereSome of the most exciting images are captured in challenging environments. A dust and moisture resistant design means that the lens will continue to perform reliably in moderately wet or dusty conditions, so you can shoot with confidence wherever those great shots are found.Outstanding colour and contrastThe ZEISS T* coating is an important contributing factor, effectively suppressing spurious reflections that can degrade overall image quality. Flare and ghosting are reduced for enhanced colour and contrast that give images a deep, three-dimensional feel.7-bladed circular apertureThe 7-blade circular makes it possible to achieve smoother, more natural defocusing in your images. Get creative with artistic blurring or 'bokeh' – and greater control over the depth of field.Supplied dedicated hood matches the lens’ compact formThe supplied ALC-SH129 is a cap type lens hood. This design is a perfect match for the compact lens barrel, contributing to both portability and protection. A filter thread is provided in the lens hood itself, allowing 40.5mm filters to be attached while the lens hood is in use. COL price VAL 629 COL priceCurrency VAL GBP	0

It is the perfect choice to improve the performance of Offices and workgroup networks.Key Features24x Gigabit Ethernet 10/100/1000M RJ45 ports.All ports support Full/half duplex transfer mode for 10Mbps/100Mbps and Full duplex transfer mode for 1000MbpsSupports Auto-MDI/MDIX functionSupports IEEE 802.3X flow control for full-duplex mode and back pressure flow control for half-duplex modeStore and forward Switching schemeStandard 19-inch rack-mountable steel caseGigabit SwitchFeatured with 24 10/100/1000Mbps ports, TP-Link TL-SG1024 Switch greatly expands your network capacity, enabling instant large files transferring. So power users in the home, office, workgroup, or creative production environment can now move large, bandwidth-intensive files faster. Transfer graphics, CGI, CAD, or multimedia files across the network instantly.Go Green With Your EthernetYou now have the choice to go green when upgrading to a gigabit network! This new generation TP-Link TL-SG1024 24-Port Gigabit Switch features the latest innovative energy-efficient technologies that can greatly expand your network capacity with much less power*. It automatically adjusts power consumption according to the link status and cable length to limit the carbon footprint of your network.Power down Idle PortsWhen a computer or network equipment is off, the corresponding port of a traditional switch will continue to consume considerable amounts of power. The TP-Link TL-SG1024 can automatically detect the link status of each port and reduce the power consumption of ports that are idle.Power Budget According to Cable LengthIdeally, shorter cables would use less power because of less power degradation over their length, this is not the case with most devices as they will use the same amount of power across the cable regardless of whether it is 10 or 50 meters in length. The TP-Link TL-SG1024 analyses the length of the Ethernet cable connected and adjusts the power usage accordingly, rather than keeping the power consumption in a conventional solution.Easy to UseThe TP-Link TL-SG1024 auto features of this gigabit switch make installation plug and play and hassle-free. No configuring is required. Auto MDI/MDIX eliminates the need for crossover cables. Auto-negotiation on each port senses the link speed of a network device (either 10, 100 Mbps or 1000 Mbps) and intelligently adjusts for compatibility and optimal performance.Standard Warranty: Limited LifetimeSpecificationStandards and ProtocolsIEEE802.3, 802.3u, 802.3ab, 802.3x CSMA/CD, TCP/IPBasic FunctionWire-speed PerformanceMAC Address Auto-Learning and Auto-agingIEEE802.3x flow control for Full-Duplex Mode and backpressure for Half-Duplex ModeBackbound Bandwidth48GbpsMAC Address Table8kForwarding Rate10BASE-T: 14880pps/port100BASE-TX: 148800pps/port1000BASE-T: 1488000pps/portTransmission MethodStore-and-ForwardPorts24 10/100/1000Mbps Auto-Negotiation RJ45 ports (Auto MDI/MDIX)Network Media10Base-T: UTP category 3, 4, 5 cable (maximum 100m)EIA/TIA-568 100Ù STP (maximum 100m)100Base-Tx: UTP category 5, 5e cable (maximum 100m)EIA/TIA-568 100Ù STP (maximum 100m)1000Base-T: UTP category 5, 5e cable (maximum 100m)LED IndicatorsPower, Link/ActSafety & EmissionFCC, CEDimensions (WxDxH)17.3 x 7.1 x 1.7 in.

TL-WR841N’s exceptional and advanced wireless performance make it ideal for streaming HD video, making VoIP and online gaming. Also, WPS button on the sleek and fashionable exterior ensures WPA2 encryptions, preventing the network from outside intrusions. Wireless N Speed & Range Complying with the IEEE 802.11n standard, TL-WR841N can establish a wireless network and get up to 15X the speed and 5X the range of conventional 11g products. Also, with transmission rates up to 300Mbps.It shows more excellent abilities of mitigating data loss over long distances and through obstacles in a small office or a large apartment, even in a steel-and-concrete building. Above all, you could easily pick up the wireless network during long-distance connection where legacy 11g products may not! Which also means, the router has the speed to work smoothly with almost any bandwidth intensive application including VoIP, HD streaming, or online gaming, without the lag.WPA / WPA2 Encryptions - Advanced Security As for the security of WI-FI connection, WEP encryption has been no longer the strongest and safest guards for outside threats. TL-WR841N provides WPA/WPA2 encryptions (Both Personal and Enterprises) that are created by the WI-FI Alliance industry group, promoting interpretabilities and security for WLAN. WPS - One Button Security The TL-WR841N features Wi-Fi Protected Setup™ (WPS) that allows users to almost instantly setup their security simply by pressing the "WPS" button automatically establishing a WPA2 secure connection, which is more security compared with WEP encryptions. Not only is this faster than normal security setups but more convenient in that you don’t need to remember a password! IP QoS－Controlled Bandwidth Allocation The speed of your wireless network is extremely temperamental, and can be due to indiscriminate users or applications hogging all the bandwidth. TP-LINK's TL-WR940N supports IP QoS (Quality of Service) function, which offers optimum utilization of bandwidth through the use of bandwidth congestion control. This means that users of small networks will enjoy bandwidth allocation specifically for them, preventing non-critical wireless usage from degrading network performance.Easy Setup The device comes with a CD with an Easy Setup Assistant that leads you through the setup process step-by-step, and even helps with wireless network settings and security configurations, which is convenient to the users, especially for novice users.TP-LINK TL-WR841N 300 Mbps WIRELESS ROUTERHARDWARE FEATURESInterface4 10/100Mbps LAN PORTS1 10/100Mbps WAN PORTButtonWPS/Reset ButtonWi-Fi On/Off ButtonPower On/Off ButtonExternal Power Supply9VDC / 0.6AWireless StandardsIEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.11g, IEEE 802.11bAntenna2*5dBi Fixed Omni Directional AntennaDimensions ( W x D x H )7.6 x 5.1 x 1.3 in.(192 x 130 x 33 mm)WIRELESS FEATURESFrequency2.4-2.4835GHzSignal Rate11n: Up to 300Mbps(dynamic)11g: Up to 54Mbps(dynamic)11b: Up to 11Mbps(dynamic)Reception Sensitivity270M: -68dBm@10% PER130M: -68dBm@10% PER108M: -68dBm@10% PER54M: -68dBm@10% PER11M: -85dBm@8% PER6M: -88dBm@10% PER1M: -90dBm@8% PERTransmit PowerCE:<20dBm(2.4GHz)FCC:<30dBmWireless FunctionsEnable/Disable Wireless Radio, WDS Bridge, WMM, Wireless StatisticsWireless Security64/128/152-bit WEP / WPA / WPA2,WPA-PSK / WPA2-PSKSOFTWARE FEATURESWAN TypeDynamic IP/Static IP/PPPoE/PPTP/L2TP/BigPondDHCPServer, Client, DHCP Client List,Address ReservationQuality of ServiceWMM, Bandwidth ControlPort ForwardingVirtual Server,Port Triggering, UPnP, DMZDynamic DNSDynDns, Comexe, NO-IPVPN Pass-ThroughPPTP, L2TP, IPSec (ESP Head)Access ControlParental Control, Local Management Control, Host List, Access Schedule, Rule ManagementFirewall SecurityDoS, SPI FirewallIP Address Filter/MAC Address Filter/Domain FilterIP and MAC Address BindingManagementAccess ControlLocal ManagementRemote ManagementOTHERSCertificationCE, FCC, RoHSPackage ContentsWireless N Rotuer TL-WR841NPower supply unitResource CDQuick Installation GuideSystem RequirementsMicrosoft® Windows® 98SE, NT, 2000, XP, Vista™ or Windows 7, MAC® OS, NetWare®, UNIX® or Linux.EnvironmentOperating Temperature: 0℃~40℃ (32℉~104℉)Storage Temperature: -40℃~70℃ (-40℉~158℉)Operating Humidity: 10%~90% non-condensingStorage Humidity: 5%~90% non-condensingWeight: 2 Kg COL price VAL 46.41 COL priceCurrency VAL AUD	COL title VAL FUJIFILM Fujinon XF 56mm f/1.2 R APD Lens COL description VAL The FUJIFILM Fujinon XF 56mm f/1.2 R APD Lens features a unique optical design, flattering portrait-length field of view, and an especially fast f/1.2 maximum aperture. Differentiating itself from FUJIFILM's other XF 56mm f/1.2 lens, this APD version incorporates an apodization filter to produce an aesthetically-pleasing out-of-focus quality to suit selective focus applications. Complementing the unique bokeh-related attributes of the lens is an equally sophisticated optical design, which features both aspherical and extra-low dispersion elements to help reduce a variety of aberrations, color fringing, and distortion. A Super EBC coating is used, too, to reduce flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color accuracy in bright and backlit conditions. Additionally, this lens also features an internal focusing mechanism for quick focusing performance along with a rounded seven-blade diaphragm to further contribute to a pleasing bokeh quality. Key Features Prime portrait-length lens is designed for APS-C-format Fujifilm X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides an 85mm equivalent focal length. Especially bright f/1.2 maximum aperture excels in low-light conditions and also offers notable control over depth of field for using selective focus techniques. Signified by the APD designation, this lens incorporates an apodization filter in order to produce controllable and aesthetically-pleasing bokeh, which is characterized by sharp main subjects, tremendously blurred background, and an overall three-dimensional quality. Since the apodization filter performs best at wider aperture values, a 3-stop ND filter is built into the lens to aid in controlling exposure. Using two separate sets of aperture values, the red series of numbers indicates the effective aperture value as it relates to depth of field. The standard white set of numbers indicates the actual f/stop number, and the difference between these two sets of numbers indicates the effectiveness of the filter. One double-sided aspherical element limits distortion and spherical aberration in order to realize greater sharpness and accurate rendering. Two extra-low dispersion elements reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to provide greater clarity and color accuracy. Super EBC coating has been applied to individual elements to reduce lens flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Internal focusing design affords fast and quiet autofocus performance that benefits both stills and video applications. Rounded seven-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing out-of-focus quality to benefit the use of selective focus and shallow depth of field techniques.

FUJIFILM XF 8-16mm f/2.8 R LM WR Lens features a constant f/2.8 maximum aperture for consistent performance throughout the zoom range. The optical layout comprises six extra-low dispersion elements, including three Super ED elements, which help to virtually eliminate chromatic aberrations and color fringing for greater clarity and color accuracy. Four aspherical elements are also used to suppress distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations for improved sharpness. Also, a Nano-GI coating helps to control ghosting and flare for enhanced contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Complementing the optics is a refined linear motor, which affords quick and quiet autofocus performance, and the lens body is weather-sealed in 11 distinct places to support working in trying environmental conditions. Impressively wide zoom is designed for FUJIFILM X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides a 12-24mm equivalent focal length range. Constant f/2.8 maximum aperture offers consistent performance throughout the zoom range and excels when working in difficult lighting conditions. Six extra-low dispersion elements, including three Super ED elements, are used to greatly reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to produce high clarity and color fidelity throughout the zoom range. Four aspherical elements control distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations, which helps to improve sharpness and realize more accurate rendering. Nano-GI (Gradient Index) coating has been applied to lens elements and alters the refractive index between the glass and air in order to better suppress lens flare and ghosting for diagonal incident light. Linear motor autofocus system delivers smooth, near-silent performance that is especially beneficial to video applications and when working in noise-sensitive areas. The lens body incorporates extensive weather sealing to protect against dust and moisture, and to enable worry-free use in inclement conditions and freezing temperatures as low as 14°F.

COL title VAL Blackmagic Design ATEM Production Studio 4K HDMI Live Switcher SWATEMPSW04K COL description VAL Key FeaturesSupports NTSC/PAL/HD/UltraHD 4K @ 10-bitSupports 4K Resolution Over SDI or HDMI4 x 6G-SDI & 4 x HDMI Inputs (4k/HD/SD)Tri-Sync/Blackburst Ref. Sync InputTheBlackmagic ATEM Production Studio 4K Live Switcheris a live event multi camera production switcher with 8 individual Ultra HD inputs built into a 1RU chassis. Supporting NTSC/PAL/HD and Ultra HD video formats via Four Single Link 6G-SDI and Four 4K HDMI inputs, the switcher connects to a wide range of cameras and sources, delivering a single program stream in SD, HD, or Ultra HD video. All this is done live and in real time with no rendering required.The switcher features a reference video input for synchronizing the switcher to other equipment using Tri-level or Blackburst Sync. Each input also features its own frame synchronizer, which allows you to use cameras that do not feature Genlock as well as input video from computer sources. The switcher can handle inputs from all inputs at the same time.The switcher provides six video outputs that are always active. Featuring one SDI and one HDMI Program output , both of which deliver SD/HD/Ultra HD, with one Aux SD/HD/Ultra HD Output that can deliver a clean Program feed without any downstream effects, as primary outputs. The switcher also features an HD only Program output signal for monitoring on an SDI-equipped HD monitor. Multiview monitoring is also HD only over dedicated SDI or HDMI output, and Multiview allows you to view the Program, Preview, six active inputs and two graphic channels (media players) on one screen at the same time. The switcher features a built-in compliment of one Upstream and two Downstream keyers for real time effects and composites in Ultra HD, with 10-bit processing. The two downstream keyers allow you to use two graphics/logos/titles/lower thirds from up to twenty stored graphics in a wide variety of formats.A built-in two channel audio mixer handles the embedded HDMI and SDI audio from the six active video inputs as well as audio from the balanced and unbalanced analog audio inputs to provide you flexibility and creative audio options. Audio output is embedded in the SDI and HDMI stream, as well as available via balanced audio outputs. Either a Mac or PC running the included ATEM Software controls the switcher's operation and settings. For those who like the feel of a physical control panel, available ATEM Broadcast Panels, connected via the Ethernet port, also control all the features of the switcher. Illuminated front panel buttons allow you to locally select the Aux output, while a two inch LCD screen built into the front of the unit allows you to see the Aux output for instant confirmation of the correct output.VideoThe ATEM Production Studio Live 4K Switcher supports 4K Ultra HD video (3840 x 2160), which is four times the resolution of Full HD. It has eight video inputs, all of which can be active simultaneously.The switcher features four single link 6G-SDI and four HDMI 4K inputs, which allows you to connect SD/HD/Ultra HD and computer-based signal to the switcher. Although the switcher takes reference video in for sync timing so that it can interface with other post production equipment, each input has its own Frame synchronizer, which enables you to use cameras that do not have genlock capability or for input of computer sources such as Keynote or PowerPoint PresentationsThe capture video format is set by the user, and must be the same across each input, as the switcher cannot scale different input formats to match the project format.AudioThe switcher includes a built-in audio mixer that allows you to adjust the audio embedded in the SDI and HDMI signals. With 10 inputs available the 2 channel mixer can also adjust levels of both the balanced and unbalanced analog inputs.6 Video OutputsThe switcher features 3 program outputs for the final video, delivering SD/HD/Ultra HD via both a 6G-SDI port and HDMI 4K connector. The third program output is an HD-SDI only port (Ultra HD is automatically down-converted).Two Multi-view outputs allow you to see Program, Preview, the 6 live inputs and the two graphic channels on one screen at the same time. There is 1 SDI and 1 HDMI connector which feeds the Multi-view output to HD monitors.The switcher features an SDI Aux output that is capable of delivering the Program out feed with or without the downstream keyer effects in SD, HD and Ultra HD. Control of the Aux output is by front mounted panel buttons, and built-in 2-inch LCD screen for immediate confirmation of the Aux output.Multi View MonitoringMulti view allows you to view the program, preview, 6 live inputs and 2 media players side by side. You can also add custom labels that make it easy to identify each input.EffectsThe switcher features an upstream keyer that includes independent chroma, pattern, shaped and luma keying all at Ultra HD resolution with 10-bit processing. Two downstream keyers allow you to add graphics, lower thirds, titles and logos for a polished live production.Control InterfaceThe ATEM 4K switcher uses an Ethernet connection to interface with control surfaces such as the optional ATEM 1 M/E and 2 M/E Broadcast Panels.You can also control the switcher by using the included ATEM Software Control software from a Mac or Windows computer over Ethernet. You can control all production settings of the switcher as well as directly import graphics from your computer into the switcher's media pool.You set the format for each project you are working on, from SD to HD to Ultra HD, selecting resolution and frame rate. This is accomplished by using either the included software for Mac/PC, or via the ATEM 1 M/E or ATEM 2 M/E Broadcast Panel.Using the Ethernet port on the switcher allows you to connect control surfaces directly to the switcher or you can control the switcher across a network.The Switcher features a mini USB port that is used for software updates and to set the switcher's Chassis IP address, which can only be done by using a computer running the ATEM Switcher Utility connected to the switcher's USB port.Rack MountThe switcher is a single RU in height and has built-in rack mount ears, for mounting in a production road case or in a post production facility.In the BoxBlackmagic Design ATEM Production Studio 4K Live SwitcherSoftware SD CardLimited 1-Year Warranty COL price VAL 1695.00 COL priceCurrency VAL USD	COL brand VAL LG COL title VAL MONITOR LG 32UK550-B 31,5\" IPS UHD 4K 4MS HDMI DP AJUSTABLE ALTURA ALTAVOCES COL description VAL MONITOR LG 32UK550-B 31,5\" IPS UHD 4K 4MS HDMI DP AJUSTABLE ALTURA ALTAVOCES COL price VAL 402.25 COL priceCurrency VAL EUR	0

Ethernet switches create separate collision domains per switch port, allowing for simultaneous data transfers to occur without interference. They also reduce the number of broadcast domains, and don't require heavy CPU usage. The Ethernet switch manages the flow of network traffic more efficiently and in a safer manner than repeater hubs. It allows for the flow of data between connected devices. Ethernet switches come in both managed and unmanaged varieties. Unmanaged switches are the easy to install, plug and play variety.

FUJIFILM XF 8-16mm f/2.8 R LM WR Lens features a constant f/2.8 maximum aperture for consistent performance throughout the zoom range. The optical layout comprises six extra-low dispersion elements, including three Super ED elements, which help to virtually eliminate chromatic aberrations and color fringing for greater clarity and color accuracy. Four aspherical elements are also used to suppress distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations for improved sharpness. Also, a Nano-GI coating helps to control ghosting and flare for enhanced contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Complementing the optics is a refined linear motor, which affords quick and quiet autofocus performance, and the lens body is weather-sealed in 11 distinct places to support working in trying environmental conditions. Impressively wide zoom is designed for FUJIFILM X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides a 12-24mm equivalent focal length range. Constant f/2.8 maximum aperture offers consistent performance throughout the zoom range and excels when working in difficult lighting conditions. Six extra-low dispersion elements, including three Super ED elements, are used to greatly reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to produce high clarity and color fidelity throughout the zoom range. Four aspherical elements control distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations, which helps to improve sharpness and realize more accurate rendering. Nano-GI (Gradient Index) coating has been applied to lens elements and alters the refractive index between the glass and air in order to better suppress lens flare and ghosting for diagonal incident light. Linear motor autofocus system delivers smooth, near-silent performance that is especially beneficial to video applications and when working in noise-sensitive areas. The lens body incorporates extensive weather sealing to protect against dust and moisture, and to enable worry-free use in inclement conditions and freezing temperatures as low as 14°F.

COL title VAL FUJIFILM XF 8-16mm f/2.8 R LM WR Lens COL description VAL The FUJIFILM XF 8-16mm f/2.8 R LM WR Lens is an ultra-wide zoom lens characterized by a bright and advanced optical design. FUJIFILM XF 8-16mm f/2.8 R LM WR Lens features a constant f/2.8 maximum aperture for consistent performance throughout the zoom range. The optical layout comprises six extra-low dispersion elements, including three Super ED elements, which help to virtually eliminate chromatic aberrations and color fringing for greater clarity and color accuracy. Four aspherical elements are also used to suppress distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations for improved sharpness. Also, a Nano-GI coating helps to control ghosting and flare for enhanced contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Complementing the optics is a refined linear motor, which affords quick and quiet autofocus performance, and the lens body is weather-sealed in 11 distinct places to support working in trying environmental conditions. Impressively wide zoom is designed for FUJIFILM X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides a 12-24mm equivalent focal length range. Constant f/2.8 maximum aperture offers consistent performance throughout the zoom range and excels when working in difficult lighting conditions. Six extra-low dispersion elements, including three Super ED elements, are used to greatly reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to produce high clarity and color fidelity throughout the zoom range. Four aspherical elements control distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations, which helps to improve sharpness and realize more accurate rendering. Nano-GI (Gradient Index) coating has been applied to lens elements and alters the refractive index between the glass and air in order to better suppress lens flare and ghosting for diagonal incident light. Linear motor autofocus system delivers smooth, near-silent performance that is especially beneficial to video applications and when working in noise-sensitive areas. The lens body incorporates extensive weather sealing to protect against dust and moisture, and to enable worry-free use in inclement conditions and freezing temperatures as low as 14°F. COL price VAL 1999.95 COL priceCurrency VAL USD	COL title VAL FUJIFILM Aspherical Super EBC XF 80mm f/2.8 R LM OIS WR Macro Lens COL description VAL The FUJIFILM Aspherical Super EBC XF 80mm f/2.8 R LM OIS WR Macro Lens s a 122mm equivalent telephoto prime for X-mount mirrorless cameras. The long focal length coupled with the f/2.8 maximum aperture is well-suited to isolating subject matter, especially when paired with the short 9.8\" minimum focusing distance, and a 1:1 life-size magnification is ideal for macro shooting. A Floating Focus System benefits close-up work by using two distinct focusing groups in order to maintain image quality throughout the focus range, and a linear motor ensures quick, quiet autofocus performance. Additionally, a five stop-effective optical image stabilization system complements making sharp imagery by minimizing the appearance of camera shake. In regard to the optical design, this lens employs one aspherical element and four low dispersion elements to realize sharp, clear imagery void of both chromatic and spherical aberrations. A Super EBC coating has also been applied to suppress flare and ghosting when working in bright and backlit conditions. Additionally, enabling the lens's use in harsh environments, it is weather-sealed and also features a fluorine coating on the front element to guard against moisture, smudging, and dust. Key Features Short telephoto prime lens is designed for APS-C-format FUJIFILM X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides a 122mm equivalent focal length. Macro lens affords a life-size 1:1 magnification ratio along with a 9.8\" minimum focusing distance for working with close-up subjects. Four extra-low dispersion elements, including one Super ED element, are used to greatly reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to produce high clarity and color fidelity. One aspherical element controls distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations, which helps to improve sharpness and realize more accurate rendering. Super EBC coating has been applied to individual elements to reduce lens flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Floating Focus System employs two distinct groups of focusing elements for faster performance as maintained image quality throughout the focusing range. Linear motor autofocus system delivers smooth, near-silent performance that is especially beneficial to video applications and when working in noise-sensitive areas. Focus range limiter switch allows you to constrain the focus range to between 9.8\" to 1.6', 1.6' to infinity, or for the whole 9.8\" to infinity range for more responsive focusing depending on the distance to your subject. A five stop-effective optical image stabilization system minimizes the appearance of camera shake for sharper handheld shooting in low-light conditions and with slower shutter speeds. The lens body is weather-sealed to protect against dust and moisture, and to enable worry-free use in inclement conditions. Additionally, this design also permits working in temperatures as low as 14°F. A fluorine coating has been applied to the front lens element to guard against smudging, moisture, and dust. Rounded nine-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing bokeh quality. Compatible with optional XF 1.4x TC WR and XF 2x TC WR teleconverters for extending the effective focal length to an equivalent 171mm and 244mm, respectively.

COL title VAL FUJIFILM Fujinon XF 56mm f/1.2 R APD Lens COL description VAL The FUJIFILM Fujinon XF 56mm f/1.2 R APD Lens features a unique optical design, flattering portrait-length field of view, and an especially fast f/1.2 maximum aperture. Differentiating itself from FUJIFILM's other XF 56mm f/1.2 lens, this APD version incorporates an apodization filter to produce an aesthetically-pleasing out-of-focus quality to suit selective focus applications. Complementing the unique bokeh-related attributes of the lens is an equally sophisticated optical design, which features both aspherical and extra-low dispersion elements to help reduce a variety of aberrations, color fringing, and distortion. A Super EBC coating is used, too, to reduce flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color accuracy in bright and backlit conditions. Additionally, this lens also features an internal focusing mechanism for quick focusing performance along with a rounded seven-blade diaphragm to further contribute to a pleasing bokeh quality. Key Features Prime portrait-length lens is designed for APS-C-format Fujifilm X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides an 85mm equivalent focal length. Especially bright f/1.2 maximum aperture excels in low-light conditions and also offers notable control over depth of field for using selective focus techniques. Signified by the APD designation, this lens incorporates an apodization filter in order to produce controllable and aesthetically-pleasing bokeh, which is characterized by sharp main subjects, tremendously blurred background, and an overall three-dimensional quality. Since the apodization filter performs best at wider aperture values, a 3-stop ND filter is built into the lens to aid in controlling exposure. Using two separate sets of aperture values, the red series of numbers indicates the effective aperture value as it relates to depth of field. The standard white set of numbers indicates the actual f/stop number, and the difference between these two sets of numbers indicates the effectiveness of the filter. One double-sided aspherical element limits distortion and spherical aberration in order to realize greater sharpness and accurate rendering. Two extra-low dispersion elements reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to provide greater clarity and color accuracy. Super EBC coating has been applied to individual elements to reduce lens flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Internal focusing design affords fast and quiet autofocus performance that benefits both stills and video applications. Rounded seven-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing out-of-focus quality to benefit the use of selective focus and shallow depth of field techniques.

From the Dissector Troy Brosnan wanted to create a “unicorn” tire – a center tread design that carried speed easily but with edge blocks worthy of world-class cornering speed. The Dissector center knobs are all heavily ramped to minimize drag but retain sharp flat edges along their backs to provide strong braking traction. Small sipes give the knobs additional flexion increasing their surface area during braking and aiding the transition to the edge blocks when cornering. A distinct channel along either side of the center knobs – along with ample spacing between all lugs – helps to clear debris.Recommended as a rear tire TECH SPECSISO Diameter 622 / road / 29"Tire Diameter 29"Weight 861Color BlackTire Intended Use MountainISO Width (mm) 61TPI 60Tire Bead FoldingPSI 50Tire Type Tubeless Ready ClincherDefined Color BlackLabeled Size 29 x 2.4 COL price VAL 68.00 COL priceCurrency VAL USD	COL brand VAL Maxxis COL title VAL Maxxis Maxxis Dissector Tire - 29 x 2.4, Tubeless, Folding, Black, 3C MaxxTerra, EXO, Wide Trail COL price VAL 75.00 COL priceCurrency VAL USD	1

COL title VAL Life Extension Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 - 100 mg 60 softgels COL description VAL Life Extension Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 helps keep the body strong and healthy by enhancing energy levels, immune functions, and cardiovascular health.Coenzyme Q10 or CoQ10 is a compound found in the energy producing part of the cell called the mitochondria. Mitochondria are considered the main energy producers in human cells. CoQ10 plays a key role in transforming the body's fat and sugar reserves into energy fuel. However, the healthy supply of CoQ10 diminishes as we grow older.It is important to keep adequate levels of CoQ10 to help in the proper functioning of the mitochondria, especially in its ability to accommodate cell energy production in the most vital systems of the body such as the heart. CoQ10 also exhibits strong antioxidant properties that help fight not only the harmful effects of free radicals, but also from LDL and DNA oxidation.Life Extension Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support contains a potent combination of highly absorbable CoQ10 compounds with shilajit, which together produces an unique synergistic effect for healthy cellular energy production. COL price VAL 34.58 COL priceCurrency VAL USD	COL title VAL Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ COL description VAL Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is formulated with ubiquinol, a highly bioavailable form of coenzyme Q10 nutrient, and augmented with the adaptogen PrimaVie® shilajit, clinically shown to further increase CoQ10 absorption, promote cardiovascular health, and help restore youthful cellular energy. Benefits at a Glance:Ubiquinol CoQ10 absorbs up to 8 times better than ubiquinone CoQ10Promotes cellular energy production in heart, brain and muscle tissueProvides superior cardiovascular and antioxidant supportPrimaVie® shilajit enhances mitochondrial CoQ10 absorptionCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level.1 Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain,2 liver, kidneys, and (most importantly) your heart.3,4CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins5 and mitochondrial DNA6 from oxidative damage.1 Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in your body deplete over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinol and shilajitThe traditional form of CoQ10, ubiquinone, is difficult for the body to absorb. But another form, ubiquinol, has been shown to absorb up to 8 times greater than ubiquinone. That’s why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system with superior absorption levels.11Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie® shilajit is an adaptogen shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP — the main source of cellular energy.12-17 When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, it has been clinically shown to double levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.18 Shilajit prolongs CoQ10’s efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form19,20 and facilitates greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.12-17In middle-aged mice, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared to ubiquinone.21 In another preliminary study in mice, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain — 40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.22Breakthrough longevity and cellular energy formulaResearch supports the value of this unique combination of ubiquinol CoQ10 and shilajit. That’s why we’ve created Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™, to create a powerful synergy that supports heart health and youthful cellular energy production better than CoQ10 alone.For younger consumers or people with no known heart health issues, we recommend a daily CoQ10 supplement with at least 100 mg of ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10. For older customers or those with heart health concerns, we recommend 200 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per day. We also offer 50 mg CoQ10 supplements for those who wish to take a lower dose or who wish to spread their CoQ10 intake throughout the day. This supplement contains 50 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per softgel.Ratings based on results of the 2019 ConsumerLab.com Survey of Supplement Users. www.consumerlab.com/survey2019.Supplement FactsServing Size 1 softgelAmount Per ServingUbiquinol (as Kaneka Ubiquinol™)50 mgPrimaVie® Shilajit fulvic acid complex50 mgOther ingredients: sunflower oil, gelatin, glycerin, purified water, beeswax, sunflower lecithin, annatto color.Non-GMOPrimaVie® is a registered trademark of Natreon, Inc.Q+®, Kaneka Ubiquinol™, and the quality seal™ are registered or pending trademarks of Kaneka Corp.Dosage and UseTake one (1) softgel once or twice daily with food, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner.WarningsKEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDRENDO NOT EXCEED RECOMMENDED DOSEDo not purchase if outer seal is broken or damaged.When using nutritional supplements, please consult with your physician if you are undergoing treatment for a medical condition or if you are pregnant or lactating.To report a serious adverse event or obtain product information, contact 1-866-280-2852.Dosage and UseTake one (1) softgel once or twice daily with food, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner.These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.This product is not for use by or sale to persons under the age of 18.

COL brand VAL Jabra COL title VAL Evolve 20 Special Edition Mono MS	COL title VAL FUJIFILM Aspherical Super EBC XF 80mm f/2.8 R LM OIS WR Macro Lens COL description VAL The FUJIFILM Aspherical Super EBC XF 80mm f/2.8 R LM OIS WR Macro Lens s a 122mm equivalent telephoto prime for X-mount mirrorless cameras. The long focal length coupled with the f/2.8 maximum aperture is well-suited to isolating subject matter, especially when paired with the short 9.8\" minimum focusing distance, and a 1:1 life-size magnification is ideal for macro shooting. A Floating Focus System benefits close-up work by using two distinct focusing groups in order to maintain image quality throughout the focus range, and a linear motor ensures quick, quiet autofocus performance. Additionally, a five stop-effective optical image stabilization system complements making sharp imagery by minimizing the appearance of camera shake. In regard to the optical design, this lens employs one aspherical element and four low dispersion elements to realize sharp, clear imagery void of both chromatic and spherical aberrations. A Super EBC coating has also been applied to suppress flare and ghosting when working in bright and backlit conditions. Additionally, enabling the lens's use in harsh environments, it is weather-sealed and also features a fluorine coating on the front element to guard against moisture, smudging, and dust. Key Features Short telephoto prime lens is designed for APS-C-format FUJIFILM X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides a 122mm equivalent focal length. Macro lens affords a life-size 1:1 magnification ratio along with a 9.8\" minimum focusing distance for working with close-up subjects. Four extra-low dispersion elements, including one Super ED element, are used to greatly reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to produce high clarity and color fidelity. One aspherical element controls distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations, which helps to improve sharpness and realize more accurate rendering. Super EBC coating has been applied to individual elements to reduce lens flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Floating Focus System employs two distinct groups of focusing elements for faster performance as maintained image quality throughout the focusing range. Linear motor autofocus system delivers smooth, near-silent performance that is especially beneficial to video applications and when working in noise-sensitive areas. Focus range limiter switch allows you to constrain the focus range to between 9.8\" to 1.6', 1.6' to infinity, or for the whole 9.8\" to infinity range for more responsive focusing depending on the distance to your subject. A five stop-effective optical image stabilization system minimizes the appearance of camera shake for sharper handheld shooting in low-light conditions and with slower shutter speeds. The lens body is weather-sealed to protect against dust and moisture, and to enable worry-free use in inclement conditions. Additionally, this design also permits working in temperatures as low as 14°F. A fluorine coating has been applied to the front lens element to guard against smudging, moisture, and dust. Rounded nine-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing bokeh quality. Compatible with optional XF 1.4x TC WR and XF 2x TC WR teleconverters for extending the effective focal length to an equivalent 171mm and 244mm, respectively.

A side-pull selector allows you to set up the tripod at three different angle configurations, enabling low angle shooting with the simple push of a button. Complementing the legs is an equally sturdy center ball head, which offers a dedicated knob for panoramic movement as well as a friction control knob for precise control over the tension during use.The final element is a dedicated 200PL-Pro quick release plate, which is made specifically for the Sony a7 and a9 series mirrorless cameras.

COL title VAL Super Ubiquinol Coq10 W/ Enhanced Mitochondrial Support 100 Mg COL price VAL 38.99 COL priceCurrency VAL USD	COL title VAL Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ COL description VAL Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is formulated with ubiquinol, a highly bioavailable form of coenzyme Q10 nutrient, and augmented with the adaptogen PrimaVie® shilajit, clinically shown to further increase CoQ10 absorption, promote cardiovascular health, and help restore youthful cellular energy. Benefits at a Glance:Ubiquinol CoQ10 absorbs up to 8 times better than ubiquinone CoQ10Promotes cellular energy production in heart, brain and muscle tissueProvides superior cardiovascular and antioxidant supportPrimaVie® shilajit enhances mitochondrial CoQ10 absorptionCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level.1 Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain,2 liver, kidneys, and (most importantly) your heart.3,4CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins5 and mitochondrial DNA6 from oxidative damage.1 Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in your body deplete over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinol and shilajitThe traditional form of CoQ10, ubiquinone, is difficult for the body to absorb. But another form, ubiquinol, has been shown to absorb up to 8 times greater than ubiquinone. That’s why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system with superior absorption levels.11Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie® shilajit is an adaptogen shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP — the main source of cellular energy.12-17 When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, it has been clinically shown to double levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.18 Shilajit prolongs CoQ10’s efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form19,20 and facilitates greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.12-17In middle-aged mice, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared to ubiquinone.21 In another preliminary study in mice, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain — 40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.22Breakthrough longevity and cellular energy formulaResearch supports the value of this unique combination of ubiquinol CoQ10 and shilajit. That’s why we’ve created Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™, to create a powerful synergy that supports heart health and youthful cellular energy production better than CoQ10 alone.For younger consumers or people with no known heart health issues, we recommend a daily CoQ10 supplement with at least 100 mg of ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10. For older customers or those with heart health concerns, we recommend 200 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per day. We also offer 50 mg CoQ10 supplements for those who wish to take a lower dose or who wish to spread their CoQ10 intake throughout the day. This supplement contains 50 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per softgel.Ratings based on results of the 2019 ConsumerLab.com Survey of Supplement Users. www.consumerlab.com/survey2019.Supplement FactsServing Size 1 softgelAmount Per ServingUbiquinol (as Kaneka Ubiquinol™)50 mgPrimaVie® Shilajit fulvic acid complex50 mgOther ingredients: sunflower oil, gelatin, glycerin, purified water, beeswax, sunflower lecithin, annatto color.Non-GMOPrimaVie® is a registered trademark of Natreon, Inc.Q+®, Kaneka Ubiquinol™, and the quality seal™ are registered or pending trademarks of Kaneka Corp.Dosage and UseTake one (1) softgel once or twice daily with food, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner.WarningsKEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDRENDO NOT EXCEED RECOMMENDED DOSEDo not purchase if outer seal is broken or damaged.When using nutritional supplements, please consult with your physician if you are undergoing treatment for a medical condition or if you are pregnant or lactating.To report a serious adverse event or obtain product information, contact 1-866-280-2852.Dosage and UseTake one (1) softgel once or twice daily with food, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner.These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.This product is not for use by or sale to persons under the age of 18.

It is made of aluminum alloy and reaches a maximum height of 59.1\" with its column extended, folding down to 15.7\" in length for simplified transport in its included carrying case.Each leg of the Befree Advanced is composed of four sections, which can be adjusted and securely locked into place with the QPL lever locks found on all segments. A side-pull selector allows you to set up the tripod at three different angle configurations, enabling low angle shooting with the simple push of a button. Complementing the legs is an equally sturdy center ball head, which offers a dedicated knob for panoramic movement as well as a friction control knob for precise control over the tension during use.The final element is a dedicated 200PL-Pro quick release plate, which is made specifically for the Sony a7 and a9 series mirrorless cameras. It is bright orange to match the body details and offers dual compatibility for RC2 and Arca-type quick release systems. As the plate is specially designed and has an anti-twist lip, please note that other non-Sony equipment may not fit on it adequately.An Easy Link attachment is available at the top portion of the leg section, and allows you to connect compatible accessories such as flashes or reflectors. This enables you to use the tripod as a support system and reduce the amount of gear you need to carry while travelling. Rubberized feet are used to avoid skidding and help keep the Befree Advanced stable in most types of terrain.

COL title VAL FUJIFILM XF 8-16mm f/2.8 R LM WR Lens COL description VAL The FUJIFILM XF 8-16mm f/2.8 R LM WR Lens is an ultra-wide zoom lens characterized by a bright and advanced optical design. FUJIFILM XF 8-16mm f/2.8 R LM WR Lens features a constant f/2.8 maximum aperture for consistent performance throughout the zoom range. The optical layout comprises six extra-low dispersion elements, including three Super ED elements, which help to virtually eliminate chromatic aberrations and color fringing for greater clarity and color accuracy. Four aspherical elements are also used to suppress distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations for improved sharpness. Also, a Nano-GI coating helps to control ghosting and flare for enhanced contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Complementing the optics is a refined linear motor, which affords quick and quiet autofocus performance, and the lens body is weather-sealed in 11 distinct places to support working in trying environmental conditions. Impressively wide zoom is designed for FUJIFILM X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides a 12-24mm equivalent focal length range. Constant f/2.8 maximum aperture offers consistent performance throughout the zoom range and excels when working in difficult lighting conditions. Six extra-low dispersion elements, including three Super ED elements, are used to greatly reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to produce high clarity and color fidelity throughout the zoom range. Four aspherical elements control distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations, which helps to improve sharpness and realize more accurate rendering. Nano-GI (Gradient Index) coating has been applied to lens elements and alters the refractive index between the glass and air in order to better suppress lens flare and ghosting for diagonal incident light. Linear motor autofocus system delivers smooth, near-silent performance that is especially beneficial to video applications and when working in noise-sensitive areas. The lens body incorporates extensive weather sealing to protect against dust and moisture, and to enable worry-free use in inclement conditions and freezing temperatures as low as 14°F.

COL title VAL SEIKO PRESAGE AUTOMATIC ZEN GARDEN - SRPD41J1 COL description VAL Back in 2010, a Seiko mechanical watch inspired by the glamour of the cocktail bar and designed especially for the Japanese market started to attract attention on the world's watch blogs, forums, and websites. In the months and years that followed, the watch became famous, and it has come to be coveted by Seiko fans all over the world. Today, we offer a series in our all-mechanical Presage collection that is based on this watch. In doing so, we bow delightedly to the wishes of Seiko enthusiasts, and we raise our grateful cocktail glasses to them all.At Baselworld 2019 Seiko introduced the Zen Garden range of Presage models with textured patterned dials that drew their inspiration from traditional Japanese gardens. The simple and serene design cues from traditional gardens are reflected in a series of five new models being added to the Presage line.Two models utilize the 4R57 calibre and come in either a silver dial with the SSA395J1 or a green dial on the SSA397J1. The dials are textured and this contrasts with the date sub-dial and power reserve gauge.The other models are the white & blue dialled SRPD39J1 & SRPD41J1 in a stainless steel case or the white dialed SRPD42J1 that comes in a rose gold colored case. Both models use the 4R35 calibre and have the date window positioned at six o’clock.MOVEMENTCaliber Number4R35Movement TypeAutomatic with manual winding capacityDurationApprox. 41 hoursExteriorCase MaterialStainless steelCrystalDual-curved sapphire crystalClaspDeployment clasp with push button releaseOther DetailsWater ResistanceSplash ResistantCase SizeThickness:11.7㎜Diameter:41.7㎜Length:48.5㎜Other SpecificationsScrew case backSee-through case backOther Features23 jewelsDate displayStop second hand function COL price VAL 1,589.00 COL priceCurrency VAL MYR	COL brand VAL Corsair COL title VAL Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x8GB) 2133MHz CL13 DDR4 COL description VAL Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x8GB) 2133MHz CL13 DDR4 available to buy online from PC Case Gear – Australia’s Premier Online PC Store.

COL title VAL Hikvision 2MP 25X Network IR PTZ Camera (DS-2DE5225IW-AE) COL description VAL The Hikvision (DS-2DE5225IW-AE) is a 2MP Speed Dome with 25x optical zoom and 1/2.8" progressive scan CMOS chip. The camera features Smart Autotracking that is designed to automatically control the direction and zoom-level of the PTZ configurations of the camera for optimised camera view. This function may be used to provide automatic, visual confirmation of detected objects reducing the rate of false alarms and can also ensure that any potential intruder remains within the camera’s line of sight.The intuitive interface of the camera allows for quick and easy remote calibration to ensure that the camera’s settings are appropriately configured in view of its operation conditions and environment.The camera is ideally suited to deployment in demanding outdoor environments where pan/tilt/zoom functionality would be an advantage, such as perimeter surveillance and airports, roads, railways, squares, parks, scenic spots, and other open venues. Advanced gatekeeper technology can be configured to move the camera to a pre-set position upon triggering of an alarm event before returning the camera to a default position after a pre-configured interval, a useful feature for applications such as facial identification. As well as this, the camera has day/night functionality, providing a round-the-clock monitoring solution. During daylight hours, the camera provides a HD colour image, switching at night-time or during periods of very poor lighting conditions to an infrared-sensitive black and white image. High Power over Ethernet provides both power and network connectivity through one cable, simplifying installation, reducing costs and time. The powerful optical zoom lens enables the camera to cover in more details expansive areas with the ability to zoom on regions of interest.Key Features: 1/2.8" progressive scan CMOS Up to 1920 × 1080@30fps resolution Min. illumination: Colour: 0.005 Lux @(F1.6, AGC ON) B/W: 0.001 Lux @(F1.6, AGC ON) 0 Lux with IR 25× optical zoom, 16× digital zoom WDR, HLC, BLC, 3D DNR, Defog, EIS, Regional Exposure, Regional Focus Up to 150 m IR distance 24 VAC & Hi-PoE Support H.265+/H.265 video compression Audio input/output Alarm input/output COL price VAL 397 COL priceCurrency VAL GBP	COL brand VAL Jabra COL title VAL Jabra BIZ 2400 II QD NC Mono 3-1 COL price VAL 199 COL priceCurrency VAL USD	0

TL-WR841N’s exceptional and advanced wireless performance make it ideal for streaming HD video, making VoIP and online gaming. Also, WPS button on the sleek and fashionable exterior ensures WPA2 encryptions, preventing the network from outside intrusions. Wireless N Speed & Range Complying with the IEEE 802.11n standard, TL-WR841N can establish a wireless network and get up to 15X the speed and 5X the range of conventional 11g products. Also, with transmission rates up to 300Mbps.It shows more excellent abilities of mitigating data loss over long distances and through obstacles in a small office or a large apartment, even in a steel-and-concrete building. Above all, you could easily pick up the wireless network during long-distance connection where legacy 11g products may not! Which also means, the router has the speed to work smoothly with almost any bandwidth intensive application including VoIP, HD streaming, or online gaming, without the lag.WPA / WPA2 Encryptions - Advanced Security As for the security of WI-FI connection, WEP encryption has been no longer the strongest and safest guards for outside threats. TL-WR841N provides WPA/WPA2 encryptions (Both Personal and Enterprises) that are created by the WI-FI Alliance industry group, promoting interpretabilities and security for WLAN. WPS - One Button Security The TL-WR841N features Wi-Fi Protected Setup™ (WPS) that allows users to almost instantly setup their security simply by pressing the "WPS" button automatically establishing a WPA2 secure connection, which is more security compared with WEP encryptions. Not only is this faster than normal security setups but more convenient in that you don’t need to remember a password! IP QoS－Controlled Bandwidth Allocation The speed of your wireless network is extremely temperamental, and can be due to indiscriminate users or applications hogging all the bandwidth. TP-LINK's TL-WR940N supports IP QoS (Quality of Service) function, which offers optimum utilization of bandwidth through the use of bandwidth congestion control. This means that users of small networks will enjoy bandwidth allocation specifically for them, preventing non-critical wireless usage from degrading network performance.Easy Setup The device comes with a CD with an Easy Setup Assistant that leads you through the setup process step-by-step, and even helps with wireless network settings and security configurations, which is convenient to the users, especially for novice users.TP-LINK TL-WR841N 300 Mbps WIRELESS ROUTERHARDWARE FEATURESInterface4 10/100Mbps LAN PORTS1 10/100Mbps WAN PORTButtonWPS/Reset ButtonWi-Fi On/Off ButtonPower On/Off ButtonExternal Power Supply9VDC / 0.6AWireless StandardsIEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.11g, IEEE 802.11bAntenna2*5dBi Fixed Omni Directional AntennaDimensions ( W x D x H )7.6 x 5.1 x 1.3 in.(192 x 130 x 33 mm)WIRELESS FEATURESFrequency2.4-2.4835GHzSignal Rate11n: Up to 300Mbps(dynamic)11g: Up to 54Mbps(dynamic)11b: Up to 11Mbps(dynamic)Reception Sensitivity270M: -68dBm@10% PER130M: -68dBm@10% PER108M: -68dBm@10% PER54M: -68dBm@10% PER11M: -85dBm@8% PER6M: -88dBm@10% PER1M: -90dBm@8% PERTransmit PowerCE:<20dBm(2.4GHz)FCC:<30dBmWireless FunctionsEnable/Disable Wireless Radio, WDS Bridge, WMM, Wireless StatisticsWireless Security64/128/152-bit WEP / WPA / WPA2,WPA-PSK / WPA2-PSKSOFTWARE FEATURESWAN TypeDynamic IP/Static IP/PPPoE/PPTP/L2TP/BigPondDHCPServer, Client, DHCP Client List,Address ReservationQuality of ServiceWMM, Bandwidth ControlPort ForwardingVirtual Server,Port Triggering, UPnP, DMZDynamic DNSDynDns, Comexe, NO-IPVPN Pass-ThroughPPTP, L2TP, IPSec (ESP Head)Access ControlParental Control, Local Management Control, Host List, Access Schedule, Rule ManagementFirewall SecurityDoS, SPI FirewallIP Address Filter/MAC Address Filter/Domain FilterIP and MAC Address BindingManagementAccess ControlLocal ManagementRemote ManagementOTHERSCertificationCE, FCC, RoHSPackage ContentsWireless N Rotuer TL-WR841NPower supply unitResource CDQuick Installation GuideSystem RequirementsMicrosoft® Windows® 98SE, NT, 2000, XP, Vista™ or Windows 7, MAC® OS, NetWare®, UNIX® or Linux.EnvironmentOperating Temperature: 0℃~40℃ (32℉~104℉)Storage Temperature: -40℃~70℃ (-40℉~158℉)Operating Humidity: 10%~90% non-condensingStorage Humidity: 5%~90% non-condensingWeight: 2 Kg COL price VAL 46.41 COL priceCurrency VAL AUD	COL title VAL TP-Link 300Mbps Wireless N Router (TL-WR841N) COL description VAL Exceptional 300Mbps wireless performanceDesigned specifically for small business and home office networking requirements, the 300Mbps Wireless N Router TL-WR841N router delivers exceptional and advanced wireless performance.

COL title VAL Life Extension Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 - 100 mg 60 softgels COL description VAL Life Extension Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 helps keep the body strong and healthy by enhancing energy levels, immune functions, and cardiovascular health.Coenzyme Q10 or CoQ10 is a compound found in the energy producing part of the cell called the mitochondria. Mitochondria are considered the main energy producers in human cells. CoQ10 plays a key role in transforming the body's fat and sugar reserves into energy fuel. However, the healthy supply of CoQ10 diminishes as we grow older.It is important to keep adequate levels of CoQ10 to help in the proper functioning of the mitochondria, especially in its ability to accommodate cell energy production in the most vital systems of the body such as the heart. CoQ10 also exhibits strong antioxidant properties that help fight not only the harmful effects of free radicals, but also from LDL and DNA oxidation.Life Extension Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support contains a potent combination of highly absorbable CoQ10 compounds with shilajit, which together produces an unique synergistic effect for healthy cellular energy production. COL price VAL 34.58 COL priceCurrency VAL USD	COL title VAL Life Extension, Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support, 50 mg, 30 Softgels COL description VAL Enhanced Delivery System for Maximum AbsorptionDietary SupplementNon GMO LE CertifiedMade with Quality Kaneka UbiquinolCoQ10 promotes heart health and cellular energy production. Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is formulated with a highly bioavailable ubiquinol form of coenzyme Q10 and augmented with the adaptogen PrimaVie® shilajit, which is shown to further increase CoQ10 absorption, promote cardiovascular health and help promote youthful cellular energy production.Your heart cells need CoQ10—but so do your other organs. That’s why CoQ10 is also highly concentrated in your brain, liver and kidneys.CoQ10 Benefits Promotes cellular energy production, especially in the high-energy organs such as the brain, the liver, kidneys & the heartContains ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10 augmented with PrimaVie® shilajit to promote mitochondrial CoQ10 absorption to support greater cellular energy outputProvides powerful cardiovascular & antioxidant supportOffers a way to offset natural CoQ10 depletion over timeCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level. Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain, liver, kidneys and your heart.CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins and mitochondrial DNA from oxidative damage. Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in the body decrease over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinolThe traditional ubiquinone form of CoQ10 is difficult for the body to absorb. That's why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system shown to absorb up to 8 times better than ubiquinone. In people taking this form of ubiquinol, high levels of plasma CoQ10 can be achieved in only four weeks.Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie® shilajit has been shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main source of cellular energy. When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, shilajit doubles levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.Shilajit prolongs CoQ10's efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form and promotes greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.CoQ10 and agingIn a pre-clinical model, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared with ubiquinone. In another pre-clinical study, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain—40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.Do your part for a healthy heart Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is a powerful formula for heart health and youthful cellular energy support.

That puts Mavic Mini in the safest drone category, which in many areas exempts it from regulations that apply to other, heavier drones. Drone pilots must always understand and follow local laws and regulations.An Optimal Flight ExperienceCreated to be the drone for everyone, even those new to drones, Mavic Mini is simple to operate and fly using the dedicated remote controller. The ultra-light design and high-grade motors provide Mavic Mini with up to 30 minutes of flight time, giving users with more time to explore and capture content. A Wi-Fi transmission signal[1] delivers stable control and an HD live feed for a clear, confident flying experience. GPS receivers and downward visual sensors detect the ground below Mavic Mini, enabling precise hovering, stable flying and accurate landing both indoors and out.Advanced Features Created to InspireThe new DJI Fly app is intuitively designed, simplifying the flying and content capturing experience so that pilots of all skill levels can make the most of Mavic Mini. Dedicated tutorials are included to help new pilots learn about flying, and pre-set editing templates add a new level of creativity to the footage. New pilots can choose to fly in Position (P) mode for basic operation, more experienced pilots can unlock more capabilities in Sport (S) mode, and content creators can choose CineSmooth (C) mode to lengthen braking time for smoother shots and more cinematic footage. Pilots can also choose from several pre-programmed flight maneuvers known as QuickShots. COL price VAL 4.99E2 COL priceCurrency VAL USD	0

Ethernet switches create separate collision domains per switch port, allowing for simultaneous data transfers to occur without interference. They also reduce the number of broadcast domains, and don't require heavy CPU usage. The Ethernet switch manages the flow of network traffic more efficiently and in a safer manner than repeater hubs. It allows for the flow of data between connected devices. Ethernet switches come in both managed and unmanaged varieties. Unmanaged switches are the easy to install, plug and play variety.

Although the switcher takes reference video in for sync timing so that it can interface with other post production equipment, each input has its own Frame synchronizer, which enables you to use cameras that do not have genlock capability or for input of computer sources such as Keynote or PowerPoint PresentationsThe capture video format is set by the user, and must be the same across each input, as the switcher cannot scale different input formats to match the project format.AudioThe switcher includes a built-in audio mixer that allows you to adjust the audio embedded in the SDI and HDMI signals. With 10 inputs available the 2 channel mixer can also adjust levels of both the balanced and unbalanced analog inputs.6 Video OutputsThe switcher features 3 program outputs for the final video, delivering SD/HD/Ultra HD via both a 6G-SDI port and HDMI 4K connector. The third program output is an HD-SDI only port (Ultra HD is automatically down-converted).Two Multi-view outputs allow you to see Program, Preview, the 6 live inputs and the two graphic channels on one screen at the same time. There is 1 SDI and 1 HDMI connector which feeds the Multi-view output to HD monitors.The switcher features an SDI Aux output that is capable of delivering the Program out feed with or without the downstream keyer effects in SD, HD and Ultra HD. Control of the Aux output is by front mounted panel buttons, and built-in 2-inch LCD screen for immediate confirmation of the Aux output.Multi View MonitoringMulti view allows you to view the program, preview, 6 live inputs and 2 media players side by side. You can also add custom labels that make it easy to identify each input.EffectsThe switcher features an upstream keyer that includes independent chroma, pattern, shaped and luma keying all at Ultra HD resolution with 10-bit processing. Two downstream keyers allow you to add graphics, lower thirds, titles and logos for a polished live production.Control InterfaceThe ATEM 4K switcher uses an Ethernet connection to interface with control surfaces such as the optional ATEM 1 M/E and 2 M/E Broadcast Panels.You can also control the switcher by using the included ATEM Software Control software from a Mac or Windows computer over Ethernet. You can control all production settings of the switcher as well as directly import graphics from your computer into the switcher's media pool.You set the format for each project you are working on, from SD to HD to Ultra HD, selecting resolution and frame rate. This is accomplished by using either the included software for Mac/PC, or via the ATEM 1 M/E or ATEM 2 M/E Broadcast Panel.Using the Ethernet port on the switcher allows you to connect control surfaces directly to the switcher or you can control the switcher across a network.The Switcher features a mini USB port that is used for software updates and to set the switcher's Chassis IP address, which can only be done by using a computer running the ATEM Switcher Utility connected to the switcher's USB port.Rack MountThe switcher is a single RU in height and has built-in rack mount ears, for mounting in a production road case or in a post production facility.In the BoxBlackmagic Design ATEM Production Studio 4K Live SwitcherSoftware SD CardLimited 1-Year Warranty COL price VAL 1695.00 COL priceCurrency VAL USD	COL title VAL LaCie Rugged Thunderbolt USB-C 2TB	0

Ethernet switches create separate collision domains per switch port, allowing for simultaneous data transfers to occur without interference. They also reduce the number of broadcast domains, and don't require heavy CPU usage. The Ethernet switch manages the flow of network traffic more efficiently and in a safer manner than repeater hubs. It allows for the flow of data between connected devices. Ethernet switches come in both managed and unmanaged varieties. Unmanaged switches are the easy to install, plug and play variety.

Sync InputTheBlackmagic ATEM Production Studio 4K Live Switcheris a live event multi camera production switcher with 8 individual Ultra HD inputs built into a 1RU chassis. Supporting NTSC/PAL/HD and Ultra HD video formats via Four Single Link 6G-SDI and Four 4K HDMI inputs, the switcher connects to a wide range of cameras and sources, delivering a single program stream in SD, HD, or Ultra HD video. All this is done live and in real time with no rendering required.The switcher features a reference video input for synchronizing the switcher to other equipment using Tri-level or Blackburst Sync. Each input also features its own frame synchronizer, which allows you to use cameras that do not feature Genlock as well as input video from computer sources. The switcher can handle inputs from all inputs at the same time.The switcher provides six video outputs that are always active. Featuring one SDI and one HDMI Program output , both of which deliver SD/HD/Ultra HD, with one Aux SD/HD/Ultra HD Output that can deliver a clean Program feed without any downstream effects, as primary outputs. The switcher also features an HD only Program output signal for monitoring on an SDI-equipped HD monitor. Multiview monitoring is also HD only over dedicated SDI or HDMI output, and Multiview allows you to view the Program, Preview, six active inputs and two graphic channels (media players) on one screen at the same time. The switcher features a built-in compliment of one Upstream and two Downstream keyers for real time effects and composites in Ultra HD, with 10-bit processing. The two downstream keyers allow you to use two graphics/logos/titles/lower thirds from up to twenty stored graphics in a wide variety of formats.A built-in two channel audio mixer handles the embedded HDMI and SDI audio from the six active video inputs as well as audio from the balanced and unbalanced analog audio inputs to provide you flexibility and creative audio options. Audio output is embedded in the SDI and HDMI stream, as well as available via balanced audio outputs. Either a Mac or PC running the included ATEM Software controls the switcher's operation and settings. For those who like the feel of a physical control panel, available ATEM Broadcast Panels, connected via the Ethernet port, also control all the features of the switcher. Illuminated front panel buttons allow you to locally select the Aux output, while a two inch LCD screen built into the front of the unit allows you to see the Aux output for instant confirmation of the correct output.VideoThe ATEM Production Studio Live 4K Switcher supports 4K Ultra HD video (3840 x 2160), which is four times the resolution of Full HD. It has eight video inputs, all of which can be active simultaneously.The switcher features four single link 6G-SDI and four HDMI 4K inputs, which allows you to connect SD/HD/Ultra HD and computer-based signal to the switcher. Although the switcher takes reference video in for sync timing so that it can interface with other post production equipment, each input has its own Frame synchronizer, which enables you to use cameras that do not have genlock capability or for input of computer sources such as Keynote or PowerPoint PresentationsThe capture video format is set by the user, and must be the same across each input, as the switcher cannot scale different input formats to match the project format.AudioThe switcher includes a built-in audio mixer that allows you to adjust the audio embedded in the SDI and HDMI signals. With 10 inputs available the 2 channel mixer can also adjust levels of both the balanced and unbalanced analog inputs.6 Video OutputsThe switcher features 3 program outputs for the final video, delivering SD/HD/Ultra HD via both a 6G-SDI port and HDMI 4K connector. The third program output is an HD-SDI only port (Ultra HD is automatically down-converted).Two Multi-view outputs allow you to see Program, Preview, the 6 live inputs and the two graphic channels on one screen at the same time. There is 1 SDI and 1 HDMI connector which feeds the Multi-view output to HD monitors.The switcher features an SDI Aux output that is capable of delivering the Program out feed with or without the downstream keyer effects in SD, HD and Ultra HD. Control of the Aux output is by front mounted panel buttons, and built-in 2-inch LCD screen for immediate confirmation of the Aux output.Multi View MonitoringMulti view allows you to view the program, preview, 6 live inputs and 2 media players side by side. You can also add custom labels that make it easy to identify each input.EffectsThe switcher features an upstream keyer that includes independent chroma, pattern, shaped and luma keying all at Ultra HD resolution with 10-bit processing. Two downstream keyers allow you to add graphics, lower thirds, titles and logos for a polished live production.Control InterfaceThe ATEM 4K switcher uses an Ethernet connection to interface with control surfaces such as the optional ATEM 1 M/E and 2 M/E Broadcast Panels.You can also control the switcher by using the included ATEM Software Control software from a Mac or Windows computer over Ethernet. You can control all production settings of the switcher as well as directly import graphics from your computer into the switcher's media pool.You set the format for each project you are working on, from SD to HD to Ultra HD, selecting resolution and frame rate. This is accomplished by using either the included software for Mac/PC, or via the ATEM 1 M/E or ATEM 2 M/E Broadcast Panel.Using the Ethernet port on the switcher allows you to connect control surfaces directly to the switcher or you can control the switcher across a network.The Switcher features a mini USB port that is used for software updates and to set the switcher's Chassis IP address, which can only be done by using a computer running the ATEM Switcher Utility connected to the switcher's USB port.Rack MountThe switcher is a single RU in height and has built-in rack mount ears, for mounting in a production road case or in a post production facility.In the BoxBlackmagic Design ATEM Production Studio 4K Live SwitcherSoftware SD CardLimited 1-Year Warranty COL price VAL 1695.00 COL priceCurrency VAL USD	0

Ethernet switches create separate collision domains per switch port, allowing for simultaneous data transfers to occur without interference. They also reduce the number of broadcast domains, and don't require heavy CPU usage. The Ethernet switch manages the flow of network traffic more efficiently and in a safer manner than repeater hubs. It allows for the flow of data between connected devices. Ethernet switches come in both managed and unmanaged varieties. Unmanaged switches are the easy to install, plug and play variety.

TL-WR841N’s exceptional and advanced wireless performance make it ideal for streaming HD video, making VoIP and online gaming. Also, WPS button on the sleek and fashionable exterior ensures WPA2 encryptions, preventing the network from outside intrusions. Wireless N Speed & Range Complying with the IEEE 802.11n standard, TL-WR841N can establish a wireless network and get up to 15X the speed and 5X the range of conventional 11g products. Also, with transmission rates up to 300Mbps.It shows more excellent abilities of mitigating data loss over long distances and through obstacles in a small office or a large apartment, even in a steel-and-concrete building. Above all, you could easily pick up the wireless network during long-distance connection where legacy 11g products may not! Which also means, the router has the speed to work smoothly with almost any bandwidth intensive application including VoIP, HD streaming, or online gaming, without the lag.WPA / WPA2 Encryptions - Advanced Security As for the security of WI-FI connection, WEP encryption has been no longer the strongest and safest guards for outside threats. TL-WR841N provides WPA/WPA2 encryptions (Both Personal and Enterprises) that are created by the WI-FI Alliance industry group, promoting interpretabilities and security for WLAN. WPS - One Button Security The TL-WR841N features Wi-Fi Protected Setup™ (WPS) that allows users to almost instantly setup their security simply by pressing the "WPS" button automatically establishing a WPA2 secure connection, which is more security compared with WEP encryptions. Not only is this faster than normal security setups but more convenient in that you don’t need to remember a password! IP QoS－Controlled Bandwidth Allocation The speed of your wireless network is extremely temperamental, and can be due to indiscriminate users or applications hogging all the bandwidth. TP-LINK's TL-WR940N supports IP QoS (Quality of Service) function, which offers optimum utilization of bandwidth through the use of bandwidth congestion control. This means that users of small networks will enjoy bandwidth allocation specifically for them, preventing non-critical wireless usage from degrading network performance.Easy Setup The device comes with a CD with an Easy Setup Assistant that leads you through the setup process step-by-step, and even helps with wireless network settings and security configurations, which is convenient to the users, especially for novice users.TP-LINK TL-WR841N 300 Mbps WIRELESS ROUTERHARDWARE FEATURESInterface4 10/100Mbps LAN PORTS1 10/100Mbps WAN PORTButtonWPS/Reset ButtonWi-Fi On/Off ButtonPower On/Off ButtonExternal Power Supply9VDC / 0.6AWireless StandardsIEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.11g, IEEE 802.11bAntenna2*5dBi Fixed Omni Directional AntennaDimensions ( W x D x H )7.6 x 5.1 x 1.3 in.(192 x 130 x 33 mm)WIRELESS FEATURESFrequency2.4-2.4835GHzSignal Rate11n: Up to 300Mbps(dynamic)11g: Up to 54Mbps(dynamic)11b: Up to 11Mbps(dynamic)Reception Sensitivity270M: -68dBm@10% PER130M: -68dBm@10% PER108M: -68dBm@10% PER54M: -68dBm@10% PER11M: -85dBm@8% PER6M: -88dBm@10% PER1M: -90dBm@8% PERTransmit PowerCE:<20dBm(2.4GHz)FCC:<30dBmWireless FunctionsEnable/Disable Wireless Radio, WDS Bridge, WMM, Wireless StatisticsWireless Security64/128/152-bit WEP / WPA / WPA2,WPA-PSK / WPA2-PSKSOFTWARE FEATURESWAN TypeDynamic IP/Static IP/PPPoE/PPTP/L2TP/BigPondDHCPServer, Client, DHCP Client List,Address ReservationQuality of ServiceWMM, Bandwidth ControlPort ForwardingVirtual Server,Port Triggering, UPnP, DMZDynamic DNSDynDns, Comexe, NO-IPVPN Pass-ThroughPPTP, L2TP, IPSec (ESP Head)Access ControlParental Control, Local Management Control, Host List, Access Schedule, Rule ManagementFirewall SecurityDoS, SPI FirewallIP Address Filter/MAC Address Filter/Domain FilterIP and MAC Address BindingManagementAccess ControlLocal ManagementRemote ManagementOTHERSCertificationCE, FCC, RoHSPackage ContentsWireless N Rotuer TL-WR841NPower supply unitResource CDQuick Installation GuideSystem RequirementsMicrosoft® Windows® 98SE, NT, 2000, XP, Vista™ or Windows 7, MAC® OS, NetWare®, UNIX® or Linux.EnvironmentOperating Temperature: 0℃~40℃ (32℉~104℉)Storage Temperature: -40℃~70℃ (-40℉~158℉)Operating Humidity: 10%~90% non-condensingStorage Humidity: 5%~90% non-condensingWeight: 2 Kg COL price VAL 46.41 COL priceCurrency VAL AUD	0
