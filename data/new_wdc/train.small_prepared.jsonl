The Dissector center knobs are all heavily ramped to minimize drag but retain sharp flat edges along their backs to provide strong braking traction. Small sipes give the knobs additional flexion increasing their surface area during braking and aiding the transition to the edge blocks when cornering.

The Dissector center knobs are all heavily ramped to minimize drag but retain sharp flat edges along their backs to provide strong braking traction. Small sipes give the knobs additional flexion increasing their surface area during braking and aiding the transition to the edge blocks when cornering.

From the Dissector Troy Brosnan wanted to create a “unicorn” tire – a center tread design that carried speed easily but with edge blocks worthy of world-class cornering speed. The Dissector center knobs are all heavily ramped to minimize drag but retain sharp flat edges along their backs to provide strong braking traction. Small sipes give the knobs additional flexion increasing their surface area during braking and aiding the transition to the edge blocks when cornering. A distinct channel along either side of the center knobs – along with ample spacing between all lugs – helps to clear debris.Recommended as a rear tire TECH SPECSISO Diameter 622 \/ road \/ 29Tire Diameter 29Weight 861Color BlackTire Intended Use MountainISO Width (mm) 61TPI 60Tire Bead FoldingPSI 50Tire Type Tubeless Ready ClincherDefined Color BlackLabeled Size 29 x 2.4 \nprice: 68.00 \npriceCurrency: USD\n\n###\n\nbrand: Maxxis \ntitle: Maxxis Maxxis Dissector Tire - 29 x 2.4, Tubeless, Folding, Black, 3C MaxxTerra, EXO, Wide Trail \nprice: 75.00 \npriceCurrency: USD\n\n###\n\nSame product?","completion":" yes"}
